4 SHAKESPEARE

For so appears this ssect majestical,

ΗυΙάἰης due course to Harsseur. Follow, follow:
Grapple your minus to sternage οἱ this navy,

And leave your lingland, as dead midnight still,
Guardcd with grandsires, babies and oid women,
Or passed or not arrived to pith and puissance3

For who is he, whose chin is but enriched

With one appearing hair, that will not follow

These cuiled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege:
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,

With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Suppose the ambassador from the F rencb comes back ς
'l‘ells Harry that the king doth offer him

Katharine his daughter, and with her to dowry
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

'l‘he offer Iikes not: and the nimble gunner

with linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
And down goes all before them!

THE EVE

Now entertain conjecture οἱ a time

When creeping murmur and the poring dark

Fills the wide vessel of the universe.

From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
'l‘he hum of either army stiily sounds,

'l'hat the fixed sentinels almost receive

'l'he secret whispcrs of each other’s watche

F ire answers fire, and through their paly flames·
Each battle sees the other’s umbered face5
