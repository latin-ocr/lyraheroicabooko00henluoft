SHAKESPEARE

Steed threatens Steed, in high and boastful nei ghs
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,

With busy hammers closing rivets up,

Give dreadful note of preparation.

The country cocks do erow, the clocks do toll,
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
Proud of their numbers and secure in solil,

The confident and over-lusty F rench

Do the low-rated English play at dice,

And chide the cripple‚ tardy-gaited night

Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp

So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires

Sit patiently and inly ruminate

The morning‘s danger, and their gesture sad,
Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon

So many horrid ghosts, O now, who will behold
The royal captain of this ruined band

Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
Let him cry ‘Praise and glory on his head! '

For forth he goes and visits all his host,

Bids them good-morrow with a modest smile,
And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
Upon his royal face there is no note

How dread an army hath enrounded him 3

Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour

Unto the weary and all-watched night,

But freshly looks and over-bears attaint

With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,
