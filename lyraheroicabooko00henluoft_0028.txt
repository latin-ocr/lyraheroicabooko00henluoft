DRAYTON

'l'hat every wretch, pining and pale before,
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks,
Α large-ss universal like the sun

llis liberal eye doth give to every one,
'l'hawing cold sear, that mean and gentle all,
Behohl, as may unworthiness defiue,

A little touch oi Harry in the night—

And so our scene must to the battle ssy.
Shakespeare.

ΤΗ Ε BA'I'I'LE

FMR stood the wind for F rance,
When we our sails advance,
Nor now to prove our chance
Longer will tarry3
But putting to the main,
At Caux‚ the mouth of Seine,
With all his martial train,
Landed King Harry.
And taking many a fort,
Furnished in warlike sort,
Marched towards Agincourt
In happy honr,
Skirinishing day by day
with those that stopped his way,
Where the F rench gen’ral lay
with all his power:
Which, in his height oi pride,
King Henry to deride,
His ransom to provide
To the king sending;
