DRAYTON

Which he neglects the while

As from a nation vile,

Yet with an angry smile
Their fall portending.

And turning to his men,
Quoth our brave Henry then,
‘ Though they to one be ten,
Be not amazed.
Yet have we well begun,
Battles so bravely won
Have ever to the sun
By fame been raised.

And for myself, quoth he,
This my full rest shall be:
England ne’er mourn for me,
Nor more esteem me ‚-
Victor I will remain
Or on this earth lie slain;
N ever shall she sustain
Loss to redeem me.

Poitiers and Cressy tell,
When most their pride did swell,
Under our swords they fell ;

No less our skill is
Than when our grandsire great,
Claiming the regal seat,
By many a warlike seat

Lopped the Freneh lilies.’
