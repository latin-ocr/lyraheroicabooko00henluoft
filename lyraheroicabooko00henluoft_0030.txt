DRAYTON

The Duke of York so dread

The eager vaward led ;

With the main Henry spetl,
Amongst his henchmen;

Excester had the rear,

A braver man not there:

O Lord, how hot they were
On the false Frenchrnen!

They now to fight are gone,
Armour on armour shone,
Drum now to drum did groan,
To hear was wonder ς
That with the eries they make
The very earth did shake,
Trumpet to trumpet spake,
Thunder to thunder.

Well it thine age became,
O noble Erpingham,
which did the signal aim
To our hid forces!
When from the meadow by,
Like a storm suddenly,
The English archery
Struck the French horses.

With Spanish yew so strong,

Arrows a eloth-yard long,

That like to serpents stung,
Piercing the weather 3
