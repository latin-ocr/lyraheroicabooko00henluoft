DRAYTON

N one from his fellow starts,

But playing manly parts,

And like true English hearts
Stuck close together.

When down their bows they threw,
And forth their bilbos drew,
And on the F rench they flew,
Not one was tardy5
Arms were from shoulders sent,
Scalps to the teeth were rent,
Down the French peasants went ;
Our men were hardy.

This while our noble king,
His broadsword brzmdishing,
Down the French host did ding
As to o'erwhelm it,
And many a deep wound lent,
His arms with blood besprent,
And many a cruel dent
Bruised his helmet.

Glo'ster‚ that duke so good,

N ext of the royal blood,

For famous England stood,
With his brave brother ;

Ckzrence, in steel so bright,

Though but a maiden knight‚

Yet in that furious fight
Scarce such another!
