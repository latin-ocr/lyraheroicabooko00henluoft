WOTTON 11

You may imagine him upon Blackheath5

Where that his lords desire him to have borne
His bruised helmet and his bended sword
Before him through the city: he forbids it,
Being free from vainness and sels-glorious pride,
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent,

Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
How London doth pour out her citizens!

The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
Like to the senators of the antique Rome,

With the plebeians swarming at their hecls,

Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in!
Slzakespeare.

LORD OF HIMSELF

How happy is he born or taught
Who serveth not another's will,-
Whose armour is his honest thought,

And simple truth his highest skill,·

Whose passions not his masters are ;
Whose soul is still prepared for death-
Not tied unto the world with care
Of prince’s ear or vulgar breath3

Who hath his ear from rumours freed5
W hose conscience is his strong retreat,
Whose state can neither flatterers seed,
Nor ruin make oppressors great 3
