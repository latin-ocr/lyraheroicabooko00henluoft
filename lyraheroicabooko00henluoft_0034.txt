Who envies none whom chance (loth mise,
Or vice; who never understood

How ‹l.epest wounds are given with praise,
Nor mles of state but rulcs of good3

Who (lod «loth late and early pray
More of his grace than gifts to lend,
And entertains the harinlcss day
With a well-chosen book or friend—

This man is free from servile bands
Of hope to rise or fear to fall:
Lord of himself, though not of lands,

And, having nothing, yet hath all.
Wolton.

TRUE BALM

chH-SPIRYH-ZD friend,
I send nor balms nor corsives to your wound3
Your faith hath found
A gentler and more agile hand to tend
The cure of that which is but corporal‚
And doubtful days, which were named critical,
Have made their fairest ssight
And now are out of sight.
Yet (loth some wholesome physic for the mind,
Wrapped in this paper lie,
Which in the taking if you misapply
You are unkind.
