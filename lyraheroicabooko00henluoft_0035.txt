JONSON : FLETCHER 15}

Your covetous hand,
Happy in that fair honour it hath gained,
Must now be reined.
True valour doth her own renown commend
In one full action3 nor have you now more
To do than be a husband of that store.
Think but how dear you bought
This same which you have caught—
Such thoughts will make you more in love with truth.
'Tis wisdom‚ and that high,
For men to use their fortune reverently‚
Even in youth.

1v
HONOUR IN BUD

IT is not growing like a tree
In bulk doth make man better be:
A lily of a day
Is fairer far in May:
Although it fall and die that night,

It was the plant and flower of light.
’ Jonson.

V
THE JOY OF BATTLE

ΑΒΜ, arm, arm, arm! the scouts are all come in,
Keep your ranks close, and now your honours win.
Eehold from yonder hill the foe appears ;

Bows, bills, glaives‚ arrows, shields, and spears!
