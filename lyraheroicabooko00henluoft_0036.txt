14 JOHN FLli'l'Cl 1151<

Like a darn< wood he comes, or tempos-t pouring;
() view the wings of horse the mendows scouring!
'she vanguard marchcs bravcly. liark, the drums!

Dub, dub!

'l'hcy meet, they meet, and now the battle comes:
Sec how the arrows ssy
'l'hat darken all the sky!
Hark how the trumpets sonnd!
Hark how the hills rebonnd—
Ἤιτει, tara, tara, tara, tara!

Hark how the horses charge! in, boys! boys, in!
'l'he battle totters; now the wounds begin:
O how they cry!
O how they die!
Room for the valiant Memnon, armed with thunder!
See how he breaks the ranks asunder!
'l'hey fly! they fly! Eumenes has the chase,
And brave Polybius makes good his place:
'l‘o the plains, to the woods,
To the rocks, to the floods,
They fly for succour. Follow, follow, follow!
Hark how the soldiers hollow!
Hey, hey!

Brave Diocles is dead,

And all his soldiers ssed 3
'l'he battle’s won, and lost,
That many a life hath eost.
