BEAUMONT : HERRICK 15

VI
IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY

MORTAmv, behold and sear!

What a change of flesh is here!

Think how many royal bones

Sleep beneath this he‘ap of stones!

Here they lie had realms and lands,

Who now want strength to stir their hands.
Here from their pulpits sealed with dust
They preach, ‘In greatness is no trust.’
Here is an acre sown indeed

With the richest‚ royall‘st seed

That the earth did e’er suck in,

Since the first man died for sin.

Here the bones of birth have cried,
‘Though gods they were, as men they died.’
Here are sands, ignoble things,

Dropt from the ruined sides of kings.
Here’s a world of pomp and state,

Buried in dust, once dead by fate.
Beaumont.

GOING A-MAYING

GET up, get up for shame! The blooming morn
Upon her wings presents the god unshorn:
See how Aurora throws her fair
Fresh-quilted colours through the air:
