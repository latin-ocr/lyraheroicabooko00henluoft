16 HERRICK

Get up, swcet slug-a-bed, and see
'l'he dew-bespangled herb and trec!
Each ssowei has wcpt and bowed tomhd the east,
Above an hour since, yet you not drcst,
Nay, not so much as out οἱ bed?
When all the birds have matins said,
And sung their thankful hymns‚ ’tis sin,
Nay, profanation, to keep in,
Whenas a thousand virgins on this day
Spring sooner than the lark to fetch in May.

Rise, and put on your foliage, and be seen

To come forth like the spring-time fresh and green,
And sweet as Flora. 'l‘ake no care
For jewels for your gown or hair:

Fear not: the leaves will strew
Gems in abundance upon you:

Besides, the childhood of the day has kept,

Against you come, some orient pearls unwept.
Come, and receive them while the light
Hangs on the (lew—locks of the night,

And Titan on the eastern hill
Retires himself, or else stands still

Till you corne forth! Wash, dress, be brief in*

praying:

F ew beads are best when once we go a-Maying.

Corne, my Corinna, come3 and coming, mark

How each field turns a street, each street a park,
Made green and trimmed with trees! see how
Devotion gives each house a bough
