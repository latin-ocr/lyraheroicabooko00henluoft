18 HERRICK

Our life is short, and our days run
As fast away as does the sun.
And, as a .apour or a drop of rain,
Once lost can ne‘er be found again,
So when or you or 1 are made
A fable, song, or fleeting shade,
All love, al! liking, all delight,
Lies drowned with us in endless night.
Then, while time serveS, and we are but decaying,
Come, my Corinna, come, let’s go a-Maying.

WHO MAY COMMAND Hm ANYTHlNG

Bm me to live, and I will live
Thy Protestant to be 5

Or bid me love and I will give
A loving heart to thee.

A heart as soft, a heart as kind,
A heart as sound and free,

As in the whole world thou canst find,
That heart I'll give to thee.

Bid that heart stay, and it will stay
To honour thy decree3

Or bid it languish quite away,
And ’t shall do so for thee.

Bid me to weep, and I will weep
While I have eyes to see;

And, having none, yet I will keep
A beart to weep sor thee.
