HERBERT 19

Bid me despair, and I'll despair
Under that eypress-tree ,-

Or bid me die, and Ι will dare
E‘en death to die for thee.

Thou art my life, my love, my heart,
The very eyes of me,
And hast command of every part,

To live and die for thee.
Herrick.

MEMENTO MORI

SWEET day, so cool, so calm, so bright—

The bridal of the earth and sky—

The dew shall weep thy fall to-night,
For thou must die.

Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,
Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,
Thy root is ever in its grave,

And thou must die.

Sweet spring, fu'll of sweet days and roses,
A box where sweets compacted lie,
My music shows ye have your closes,

And all must die.

Only a sweet and virtuous soul

Like seasoned timber never gives,

But, though the whole world turn to coal,
Then chiefly lives.
