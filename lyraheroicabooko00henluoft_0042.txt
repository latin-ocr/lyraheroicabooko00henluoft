THE KING OF KINGS

‘rus glories ot our birth and state
Are shadows, not substantial things:
There is no armour against fate:
Death lays his icy hand on kings:
Sceptre and crown
Must tumble down,
And in the (lust be equal made
with the poor crooked scythe and spade.

Some men with swords may reap the field,
And plant fresh laureis when they kin,
But their strong nerves at last must yield:
They tame but one another still.
Early or late
'l‘hey stoop to fate,
And must give up their murmuring breath
When they, pale captives, creep to death.

The garlands wither on their brow—
'l'hen boast no more your mighty deeds!
Upon Death‘s purple altar now
See where the victor-victim bleeds!
All heads must come
To the cold tomb:
Only the actions of the just
Smell swect, and blossom in their dust.
