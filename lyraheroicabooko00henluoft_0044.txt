Battening our flocks with the fresh dews οἱ night,
Ost till the star that rose at evcning bright
'I‘owards howen's ‹lesccnt had sloped his westering
wheel.

Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,
'l'empered to the oaten flute3
Rough satyrs danccd, ano fauns with cloven heel
From the glad sound would not be absent long3
And old Damoetas loved to hear our song.

But O the heavy change, now thou art gone,
Now thou art gone, and never must return!
'l‘hee‚ Shepherd, thee the woods, and desert caves
W ith wild thyme and the gadding vine o’ergrown,
And all their echoes, mourn.
The willows and the hazel copses green
Shall now no more be seen
Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.
As killing as the canker to the rose,
Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,
Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear
When first the white-thorn blows,
Such, Lycidas, thy loss to Shepherds’ ear.

Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep
Closed o‘er the head of your loved Lycidas?
For neither were ye playing on the steep
Where your old bards, the famous Druids‚ lie,
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream:
Ay me! Ι fondly dream
‘Had ye been there,’ . . . for what could that have

done?
