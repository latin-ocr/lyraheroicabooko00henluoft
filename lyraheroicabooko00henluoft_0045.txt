MILTON 23

What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,
The Muse herself, for her enchanting son
Whom universal nature did lanient,

When by the rout that made the hideous roar
His gory visage down the stream was sent,
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?

Alas! what boots it with incessant care
To tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade,
And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?

Were it not better done, as others use,

,To sport with Amaryllis in the shade

Or with the tanglcs of Neaem’s hair?

Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
(That last infirmity of noble mind)

To scorn delights and live laborious days 3

But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,

And think to burst out into sudden blaze,

Comes the blind F ury with the abhorred shears,
And slits the thin-spun life. ‘ But not the praise‚’
Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears :
‘ Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,

Nor in the glistering soil

Set off to the worldnor in broad rumour lies,
But lives and spreads alost by those pure eyes
And perfect witness of all-judging Jove 3

As he pronounces lastly on each deed,

Of so much farne in heaven expect thy meed.'

O fountain Arethuse‚ and thou honoured flood‚
Smooth·sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,
That strain Ι heard was of a higher mood Ξ
But now my oat proceeds,
