‘24 Ml LTON

And listens to the Herald os the Sea

'rhat came in Neptune’s plea.

He asked the waves, and asked the selon winds,

What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?

And questioned every gust of mgged wings

'l'hat blows from oss each beaked proniontoryt

They knew not of his story,

And sage Hippotades their answer brings,

'rhat not a blast was from his dungeon strayed:

The air was calm, and on the level brine

Sleek Panope with all her sisters played.

It was that fatal and perfidious bark,

Built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark,

'l'hat sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
Next‚ Canius, reverend sire, went footing slow,

His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge,

Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge

Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.

‘Ahl who hath reft,’ quoth he, ‘my dearest pledge? ’

Last came, and last did go,

The I’ilot of the Galilean Lake;

Two massy keys he bore ot* metals twain

(The golden opeS, the iron shuts amain).

He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:

‘How well could I have spared for thee, young

swain,

Enow of such as for their bellies' sake

Creep, and intrude, and clinib into the sold!

()ί other care they little reckoning make

'l'han how to scramble at the shearers’ feast,

And shove away the worthy bidden guest ς
