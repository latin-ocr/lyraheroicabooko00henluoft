MILTON 25

Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to
hold

A sheep-hook, or have learnt aught else the least

That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!

What recks it them? What need they? They are

sped3

And, when they list, their lean and flashy songs

Grate on their serannel pipes of wretched straw3

The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,

But, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,

Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:

Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw

Daily devours apace, and nothing said:

But that two-handed engine at the door

Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.’
Return, Alpheus, the dread voice is past

That shrunk thy streams3 return, Sicilian Muse,

And call the vales, and bid them hither cast

'l'heir bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.

Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use

Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,

On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks;

Throw hither all yourquaint enamelled eyes

That on the green turf suck the honeyed show-ers,

And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.

Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,

The tufted crow-toe and pale J'essamine,

The white pink and the pansy freaked with iet,

The glowing violet,

The musk-rose and the well-attired woodbine,

With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,
