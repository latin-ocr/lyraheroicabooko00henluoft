And every flower that sad embroidery wears:

Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,

And dafladillies fill their cups with tears,

'l'o strew the laurente hearse where Lycid lies.

For, so to interpose a little ease,

Let our smil thoughts dally with false surmise;

Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas

Wash far away, where‘er thy bones are hurled;

Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,

Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide

Vrsit’st thc bottom of the monstrous world3

Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,

Sleep’st by the fable of Bellerus old,

Where the great vision οἱ the guarded mount

Looks toward N amancos and Bayona's hold;

Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:

And, O ye dolphins, wast the hapless youth.
Weep no more, woeiul shepherds, weep no more,

For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,

Sunk though he be bencath the watery floor.

So sinks the day—star in the ocean bed,

And yet anon repairs his drooping head,

And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore

Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:

So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,

'l'hrough the dcar might of nim that walked the

waves,

Where, other groves and other streams along,

With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,

And hears the uncxpressive nuptial song,

In the blest kingdoms mcek of joy and love.
