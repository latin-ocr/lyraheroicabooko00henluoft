There entertain him all the Saints above,
In solemn troops and sweet societies
That sing, and singing in their glory move,

¹ And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes,

Now, Lycidas, the Shepherds weep no more3
Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good
To all that wander in that perilous flood.

Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills,
While the still morn went out with sandals grey3
He touched the tendet stops of various quills,
With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:

And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,
And now was dropt into the western bay:

At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue3
To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.

CAPTAIN‚ or Colonel‚ or Knight in Arms,

Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize,
If deed of honour did thee ever please,

Guard them, and him within protect from harms.
He can require thee3 for he knows the charms

That call fame on such gentle acts as these,

And he can spread thy name o’er land and seas‚
Whatever clime the sun’s bright circle warms.

Lift not thy spear against the Muses’ bower:
