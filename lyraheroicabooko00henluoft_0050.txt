The great Emanthian conqueror bid spate
'l'he house of Pindarus, when temple and tower
Went to the ground; and the repeated air

Of sad 1·21ectra's poet had the power

'l'o save the Athenian walls from ruin bare.

TO THE LORD GENERAL

Cmmwem„ our chief of men, who through a cloud
Not of war only, but detractions rude,
Guided by saith and matchless fortitude,
'so peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed,
And on the neck οἱ crown'ed Fortune proud
Hast reared God‘s trophies, and his work pursued,
While Darwen stream, with blood of Scotsjmbrued,
And Dunbar field, resounds thy praises loud,
And Worcester’s laurente wreath: yet much remains
'I'o conquer stim peace hath her victories
No less renowned than war: new foes arise,
'l'hreatening to bind our souls with secular chains.
Help us to save free conscience from the paw
Of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw.

Avnxoss, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones
Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold3
Evcn them who kept thy truth so pure of old,
