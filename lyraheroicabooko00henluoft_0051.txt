MILTON 29

When all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones,
Forget not: in thy book record their groans

Who were thy sheep, and in their ancient sold
Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that rolled
Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans
The vales redoubled to the hills, and they

To heaven. Their martyred blood and ashes sow
O’er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway
The triple Tyrant3 that from these may grow

A hundredfold, who, having learnt thy way,

Early may fly the Babylonian woe.

ΟΝ HIS BLINDNESS

WHEN I consider how my light is spent

Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,

And that one talent which is death to hide

Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present

My true account, lestsHe, returning, chide3

‘Doth God exact day—labour, light denied?;

Ι fondly ask: but patience, to prevent

That murmur soon replies: ‘God doth not need
Either man's work or his own gifts. Who best
Bear his mild yoke‚ they serve him best. His state
Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,

And post o’er land and ocean without rest 3

They also serve who only stand and wait.’
