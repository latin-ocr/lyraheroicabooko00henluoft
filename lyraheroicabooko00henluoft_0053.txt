OUT OF ADVERSITY

O How comely it is, and how reviving
To the spirits of just men long oppressed,
When God into the hands of their deliverer
Puts invincible might
To quell the mighty of the earth, the oppressor,
The brute and boisterous force of violent men,
Hardy and industrious to support
Tyrannio power, but raging to pursue
The righteous and all such as honour truth!
He all their ammunition
And feats of war defeats,
With plain heroic magnitude of mind
And celestial vigour armed 3
Their armouries and magazines contemns‚
Renders them useless, while
With winged expedition
Swift as the lightning glauce he executes
His errand on the wicked, who, surprised,

Lose their defence, distracted and amazed.
’ Milton.

HEROIC LOVE

Mv dear and only love, I pray
That little world of thee

Be governed by no other sway
But purest monarchy3
