LOVELACE

For if confusion have a part,
Which virtuous souis abhor,

And hold a synod in thy heart,
1¹11 never iove thee more.

Like Alexander 1 will reign,
And 1 will reign alone:

My thoughts did evermore disdain
A rival on my throne.

He either fears his fate too much,
Or his deserts are small,

Who dares not put it to the touch,
To gain or lose it an.

But, is thou wilt prove faithful then
And constant of thy word,

I'll make thee glorious by my pen,
And faunous by my sword ς

I’ll serve thee in such noble ways
Was never heard before ;

1’11 crown and deck thee all with bays

And love thee more and more.
Montrose.

GOING TO THE WARS

Tem„ me not, Sweet, I am unkind,
'l‘hat from the nunnery

Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
To war and arms 1 fly.
