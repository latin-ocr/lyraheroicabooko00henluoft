LOVELACE

True, a new mistress now I chase,
The first foe in the field,

And with a stronger saith embrace
A sword, a horse, a shield.

Yet this inconstancy is such
As you too shall adore:

Ι could not love thee, Dear, so much
Loved I not Honour more.

FROM PRISON

WHEN Love with unconfined wings
Hovers within my gates,

And my divine Althea brings
To whisper at the grates;

When Ι lie tangled in her hair
And settered to her eye,

The Gods that wanton in the air
Know no such liberty.

When flowing cups run swiftly round
With no allaying Thmes,

Our careless heads with roses crowned,

Our hearts with loyal flames3
When thirsty grief in wine we steep,

When healths and draughts go free,
Fishes that tipple in the deep

Know no such liberty.
