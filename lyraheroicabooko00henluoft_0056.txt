M ARVELL

When, linnct-likc confini-d, 1
with shriller thront shall sing
'l'ixc swectneSS‚ merc), majesty,
And glories of my King;
When 1 shall voice aloud how good
He is, how great should be,
Enlarged winds that curl the flood
Know no such liberty.

Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars a cage;

Minds innocent and quiet take
That sor an hermitage:

If 1 have freedom in my love
And in my soul am free,

Angels alone that soar above
Enjoy such liberty.

Lovelace.

TWO KINGS

Tun fol-ward youth that would appear
Must now forsake his Muses dear‚

Nor in the shadows sing
His numbers languishing.

’Tis time to leave the books in dust,
And oil the unused armour’s rust,

Removing from the wall
The corselet of the hall.
