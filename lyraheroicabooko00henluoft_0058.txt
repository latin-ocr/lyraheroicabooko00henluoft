MARVELL

Though Justice against Fate complain,
And plead the ancient rights in vain

(But those do hold or break,
As men are strong or weak),

Nature, that hated emptiness,
Allows of penetration less,
And therefore must make room
Where greater spirits come.

What field of all the civil war,

Where his were not the deepest sear?
And Hampton shows what part
He had of wiser art,

Where, twining subtile fears with hope,
He wove a net of such a scope
That Charles himself might chase
To Carisbrook’s narrow case,

That thence the royal actor borne

The tragic scaffold might adom:
While round the armed bands,
Did clap their bloody hands.

He nothing common did or mean
Upon that memorable scene,

But with his keener eye

The axe's edge did try3

Nor called the gods with vulgar spite
To vindicate his helpless right,
But bowed his comely head
Down‚ as upon a bed.
