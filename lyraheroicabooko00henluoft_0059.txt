MARVELL

This was that memorable hour
Which first assured the forced power:
So, when they did design
The Capitol's first line,

A bleeding head, where they began,
Did {right the architects to run3
And yet in that the State
F oresaw its happy fate!

And now the Irish are ashamed

To see themselves in one year tamed:
So much one man can do
That doth. both act and know.

They can affirm his praises best,

And have, though overcome‚ confessed
How good he is, how just,
And fit for highest trust3

Nor yet grown stiffer with command,
But still in the Republic’s hand
(How fit he is to sway,
That can so well obey !),

He to the Commons⁷ feet presents

A kingdom for his first year's rents,
And (what he may) forbears
His fame to make it theirs:

And has his sword and spoils ungirt
To lay them at the public's skirt.
So when the falcon high

Falls heavy from the sky,
