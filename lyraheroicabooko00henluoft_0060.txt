MARVELL

She, having killed, no more doth search

But on the next green bough to perch,
Where, when he first does lure,
The falconer has her sure.

What may not then our isle presume
While victory his erest does plume?
What may not others {ear
If thus he crowns each year?

As Caesar he, ere long, to Gaul,
To Italy an Hannibal,
And to all states not free
Shall climacteric be.

The Pict no shelter now shall find

Within his party-coloured mind,
But from this valour sad
Shrink underneath the plaid;

Happy if in the tulted brake
The English hunter him mistake‚

Nor lay his hounds in near
The Caledonian deer.

But thou, the war's and fortune‘s son,
March indefatigably on,

And lor the last effect,

Still keep the sword erect:

Besides the force it has to {right

The spirits οἱ the shady night,
The same arts that did gain,
A power must it maintain.
