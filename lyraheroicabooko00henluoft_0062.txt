40 DRYDEN

He cast (of which we rather boast)
The Gospel's pearl upon our coast,
And in these rocks for us did {rame
A temple where to sound his name.
O let our voice his praise exalt
’Till it arrive at beaven’s vault,
Which thence (perhaps) rebounding may
Echo beyond the Mexique Bayl’

Thus sang they in the English boat
A holy and a cheerful note:
And all the way, to guide their chime,

With falling oars they kept the time.

ALEXANDER’S FEAST

’Twas at the royal feast for Persia won
By l’hilip‘s warlike son:
Aloft in awful state
The godlike hero sate
On his imperial throne;
His valiant peers were placed around,
Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
(So should desert in arms be crowned);
The 10ve1‘y Thais by his side
Sate like a blooming Eastern bride
In flower of youth and beauty’s pride.
Harpy, happy» happy pair!
None but the brave,
None but the brave,
None but the bravc descrves the fair!
