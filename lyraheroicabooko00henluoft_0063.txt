With flying fingers touched the lyre:

And heavenly joys inspire.

Sublime on radiant spires he rode
When he to fair Olympia pressed,
And while he sought her snowy breast‚
Then round her slender waist he curled,
And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the

A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound:

Assumes the god 5
Afiects to nod
And seems to shake the spheres.

Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:
The jolly god in triumph eomes;
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!

He shows his honest face:
