42 DRYm-:N

Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes!
Bacchus, ever fair and young,
Drinking joys did first ordain;
Bacchus’ blessings are a treasure,
Drinking is the soldier’s pleasure:
Rich the treasurc,
Sweet the pleasme,
Sweet is pleasure after pain.

Soothed with the sound the king grew vain3
Fought all his battles o'er again,
And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew
the slain!
The master saw the madness rise,
His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes;
And while he heaven and earth defied
Changed his hand, and checked his pride.
He chose a mournfu1 Muse
Soft pity to infuse:
He sung Darius great and good,
By too severe a fate
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
Fallen from his high estate,
And weltering in his blood;
Deserted at his utmost need
By those his former bounty fed,
On the bare earth exposed he lies
with not a friend to close his eyes.
With downcast looks the joyless victor sate,
Revolving in his altered soul
'l‘he various turns οἱ Chance below 3
