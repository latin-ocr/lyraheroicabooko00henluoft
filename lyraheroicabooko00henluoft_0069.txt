CHEVY CHACE
THE HUNTING

GOD prosper long our noble king,
Our lives and safeties all3

A woeful hunting once there did
In Chevy-Chace befall 3

To drive the deer with hound and horn
Erle Percy took his way3

The child may rue that is unborn,
The hunting os that day.

The stout Erle of Northumberland
A vow to God did make,

His pleasure in the Scottish woods
Three summerâ€™s days to take,

The chiefest harts in Chevy-Chace
To kill and bear away.

These tydings to Erle Douglas came,
In Scotland where he lay:

Who sent Erle Percy present word,
He wold prevent his sport.

The English Erle, not fearing that,
Did to the woods resort
