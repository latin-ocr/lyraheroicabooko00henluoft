BALLADS

While Ι have power to wield my sword‚

Ile fight with heart and hand.‘

THE BATTLE

Our English arehers bent their bowes,
Their hearts were good and trew,
At the first ssight of arrowes sent,
Full fourscore Scots they slew.

Yet bides Erle Douglas on the bent,
As Chieftain stout and good.

As valiant Captain, all unmoved
The shock he firmly stood.

His host he parted had in three,
As leader ware and try⁷d,

And soon his spearmen on their foes
Bate down on every side.

Throughout the English archery
They dealt full many a wound;

But still our valiant Englishmen
All firmly kept their ground,

And, throwing strait their bowes away,
They grasped their swords so bright,

And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,
On shields and helmets light.

They closed full fast on every side,
No slackness there was found 3

And many a gallam: gentleman
Lay gasping on the ground.
