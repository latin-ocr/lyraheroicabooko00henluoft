BALLADS

Who never spake more words than these,

‘Fight on, my merry men all3
For why, my life is at an end3
Lord Percy sees my fall.’

Then leaving life, Erle Percy tooke
The dead man by the hand3

And said, ‘Erle Douglas, for thy life
Wold I had lost my land!

O Christ! my very beart doth bleed
With sorrow t'or thy sake,

For sure, a more redoubted knight
Mischance could never take.'

A knight amongst the Scots there was,
Which saw Erle Douglas dye,

Who straight in wrath did vow rex-enge
Upon the Lord Percye.

Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he called
Who, with a speare most bright‚

Well-mounted on a gallant steed‚
Ran fiercely through the fight,

And past the English archers all,
Without or dread or feare,

And through Erle Percy’s body then
He thrust his hateful speare.

With such a vehement force and might
He did his body gooe,

The staff ran through the other side
A large eloth-yard, and more.
