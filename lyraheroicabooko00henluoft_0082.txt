BALLADS

So thus did both these nobles dye,
Whose courage none could staine!

An English archer then perceived
The noble Erle was slaine:

He had a bow bent in his hand,
Made οἱ a trusty tree;

An arrow of a eloth-yard long
Up to the head drew he;

Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye
So right the shait he set,

The grey goose-winge that was thereon
In his heart's bloode was wet.

This fight did last from breake of day
Till setting of the sun;

For when they rung the evening·beli‚
The battle scarce was done.

THE SLAIN

With stout Erle percy, there was slaine
Sir John of Egerton,

Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,
Sir James, that bold barbn3

And with Sir George and stout Sir James,
Both knights of good account,

Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slaine,
W hose prowesse did surmount.

For Witherington needs must Ι wayle,
As one in doleful dumpes 3
