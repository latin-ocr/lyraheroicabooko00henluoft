BALLADS

For when his legs were §mitten off,
He fought upon his stuinpes.

And with Erle Douglas, there was slaine
Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,

Sir Charles Murray, that from the field
One foote would never flee 3

Sir Charles Murray, of Ratcliff, too,
His sister's sonne was he3

Sir David Lamb, so well esteemed,
Yet saved he could not be 3

And the Lord Maxwell in like case
Did with Erle Douglas dye:

Of twenty hundred Scottish speares,
Scarce fifty-five did flye.

Os fifteen hundred Englishmen,
Went home but fifty—three:

The rest were slaine in Chevy—Chace,
Under the greene woode tree.

Next day did niany widdowes come,
Their husbands to bewayle 3

They washt their wounds in brinish teares,

But all wold not prevayle ;

Their bodyes, bathed in purple gore,
They bore with them away 3

They kist them dead a thousand times,
Ere they were clad in clay.
