The newes was brought to Eddenborrow,
Where Scotland's king did migne,
That brave Erle Douglas suddenlye
Was with an arrow slaine:

‘O heavy newes,' King James did say,
‘Scotland may witnesse be,

1 have not any captaine more
Of such account as he.'

Like tydings to King Henry came,
Within as short a space,

‘l'hat Percy of Northumberland
Was slaine in Chevy-Chace:

‘Now God be with him,’ said our king.
‘ Sith it will no better be;

1 trust I have, within my realme‚
Five hundred as good as he:

Yet shall not Scots nor Scotland say,
But I will vengeance take:

I’ll be revenged on them all,
For brave Erle Percy’s sake.’

This vow full well the king performed
After, at Humbledowne3 '

In one day, fifty knights were slayne,
with lords of great renowne,

And of the rest, of small account,
Did many thousands dye.
