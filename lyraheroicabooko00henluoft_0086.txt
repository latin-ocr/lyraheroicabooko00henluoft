BALLADS

The neist word that Sir Patrick read,
The tear blinded his ee.

‘O wha is this has done this deed,
And tauld the King οί me,

To send us out at this time 0' year
To sail upon the sea?

Be it wind, be it weet, be it hail, be it sleet,
Our ship must sail the faem5

The King’s daughter to N oroway‚
'Tis we must bring her hame.’

They hoysed their sails on Monday morn
Wi‘ a’ the speed they may 3

They hae lauded in Noroway
Upon a Wodensday.

They hadna been a week, a week,
In N oroway but twae,

When that the lords o’ Noroway
Began aloud to say:

‘Ye Scottishmen spend a’ our King's goud
And a' our Queenis fee.’

‘Ye lie, ye lie, ye liars loud,
Fu' loud I hear ye lie!

For I brought as mickle white monie
As gane my men and me,

And Ι brought a half-fou 0‘ gude red goud
Out-o’er the sea wi’ me.

Mak’ ready, mak' ready, my merry men a’!
Our gude ship sails the mom.’
