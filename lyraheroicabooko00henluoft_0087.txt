BALLADS 59

‘Now‚ ever alake, my master dear,
I {ear a deadly storm.

I saw the new moon late yestreen
wi’ the auld moon in her arm;
And, if we gang to sea, master,
I sear we’ll come to harm.’

They hadna sailed a league, a league,
A league but barely three,

When the list grew dark‚ and the wind blew lond,
And gurly grew the sea.

‘O where will Ι get a gude sailor
To tak' my helm in hand,

Till I gae up to the tall topmast
To see if Ι can spy land?'

‘O here am Ι, a sailor gude,
To tak’ the helm in hand,

Till you gae up to the tall toprnast3
But Ι sear you'll ne’er spy land.'

He hadna gane a step, a step,
A step but barely ane,

When a bolt flew out o' our goodly ship,
And the salt sea it earne in.

‘Gae fetch a web 0‘ the silken claith,
Anither o’ the twine,

And wap them into our ship‘s side,
And letna the sea come in.’

They fetched a web 0' the silken elaith‚
Anither o' the twine,
