But still the sea cam’ in.

Ο laith, laith were our gude Scots lords
To ueet their cork-heeled shoon;

But lang ere a' the play was played
They wat their hats aboon.

O lang, lang may the ladies sit
Wi‘ their fans intill their hand,

Before they see Sir I'atrick Spens
Come sailing to the strand!

And lang, lang may the maidens sit
wi’ their goud kaims in their hair,

A’ waiting for their ain dear loves!
For them they’ll see nae mair.

Half ower‚ half ower to Aberdour,
It's fifty fathoms deep,

And there lies gude Sir Patrick Spens
Wi’ the Seots lords at his feet.
