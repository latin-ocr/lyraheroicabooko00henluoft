BALLADS

The most conspicuous Officers
Were English captains three,

But the bravest man in battel
Was brave Lord Willoughby.

The next was Captain Norris,
A valiant man was he:

The other, Captain Tmner,
From field would never flee.

With fifteen hundred fighting men,
Alas! there were no more,

They fought with forty thousand then
Upon the bloody shore.

‘stand to it, noble pikeman,
And look you round about:

And shoot you right, you bow-men,
And we will keep thern out:

You musquet and eailiver men,
Do you prove true to 1116,

I’ll be the bravest man in fight,'
Says brave Lord Willoughby.

And then the bloody enemy
They fiercely did assail,

And fought it out most furiously,
Not doubting to prevail:

The wounded men on both sides fell
Most piteous for to see,

But nothing could the courage quell
Of brave Lord Willoughby.
