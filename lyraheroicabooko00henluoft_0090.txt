This fight endured sore,

Until our men so fceble grew

Full savourly they eat,

And drank the puddle water,
That could no better get.

When they had fed so freely,
They kneeled on the ground,
And praised God devoutly
For the favour they had found ς
And bearing up their colours,
The fight they did renew,
And cutting tow⁷rds the Spaniard,
Five thousand more they slew,

The sharp steel-pointed arrows
And bullets thick did fly;

Charge on most furiously:

They thought it best to fiee:

They feared the stout behaviour
Of brave Lord W illoughby.

1 sear we shall be spoiled all
11 that we longer stay:
