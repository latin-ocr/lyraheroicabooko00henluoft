BALLADS

For yonder comes Lord W illoughby
With courage fierce and fell,

He will not give one inch of ground
For all the devils in hell.'

And when the fearful enemy
Was quickly put to ssight,
Our men pursued comageously
To rout his forces quite3
And at last they gave a shout
Which echoed through the sky:
‘God‚ and St. George for England ἒ ’
The conquerors did cry.

This news was brought to England
With all the speed might be,

And soon our gracious Queen was told
Of this same victory.

‘01 this is brave Lord xvillonghby,
My love that ever won:

Of all the lords of honour
’Tis he great! deeds hath done! ’

To the soldiers that were maimed,
And wounded in the fray,

The queen allowed a pension
Of fifteen pence a day,

And from all costs and charges
She quit and set them free:

And this she did all for the sake ·
Of brave Lord Willoughby.
