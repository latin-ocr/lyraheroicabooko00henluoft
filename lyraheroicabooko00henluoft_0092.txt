Then courage, noble Engffihmen,
And never be dismayed!

Π that we be but one to ten,
We will not be afraid

To fight with foreign enemies,

And set our country free.
And thus 1 end the bloody bout
Of brave Lord willoughby.

HUGHIE THE GRAEME

Goon Lord Scroope to the hills is gane,
Hunting of the {allow deer;

And he has grippit Hughie the Graeme
For stealing of the Bishop's mare.

‘Nom good Lord Scroope, this may not be!
Here hangs a broadsword by my side ς
And if that thou canst conquer me,
The matter it may soon be tried.'

‘I ne'er was afraid of a traitor thien
Althongh thy name be Hughie the Graeme,
I'll make thee repent thee of thy deeds,
If God but grant me lise and time.'

But as they were dealing their blows so free,
And both so bloody at the time,
Over the moss came ten yeomen so mn,

All sor to take bold Hughie the Graeme.
