BALLADS

Had Willie had but twenty men,
But twenty men as stout as he,

Fause Sakelde had never the Kinmont ta‘en‚
Wi’ eight seore in his cumpanie.

They band his legs beneath the steed‚
They tied his hands behind his back3
They guarded him fivesome on each side,

And they brought him ower the Liddel-rack.

They led him thro’ the Liddel-rack,
And also thro' the Carlisle sands3

They brought him on to Carlisle eastle
To be at my Lord Scroope's command&

‘My hands are tied, but my tongue is free,
And wha will dare this deed avow?

Or answer by the Border law?
Or answer to the bold Buccleuch? '

‘Now haud thy tongue, thou rank reiver!
There’s never a Scot shall set thee free:
Before ye cross my castle yett‚
Ι trow ye shall take farewell o' me.’

‘Fear na ye that, my lord‚' quo’ Willie:

‘By the saith o' my body, Lord Seroope,’ he said,

‘1 never yet lodged in a hostelrie
But Ι paid my lawing before 1 gaed.’

THE KEEPER'S WRATH

Now word is gane to the bold Keeper,
In Branksome Ha' where that he lay,
