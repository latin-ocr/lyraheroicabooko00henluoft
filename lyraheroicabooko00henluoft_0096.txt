08 BALLA DS

T hat Lord Scroope has ta’en the Kinmont Willie,
Between the hours of night and day.

Ile has ta'cn the table wi’ his hand,
He garred the red wine spring on hie:
‘ Now a curse upon my head,' he said,
‘But avenged of Lord Scroope I’ll be Ξ

O is my basnet a widow’s curch?

Or my lance a wand of the willow-tree?
Or my arm a lady's lily hand,

'l‘hat an English lord should lightly me!

And have they ta'en him, Kinmont Willie,
Against the truce of Border tide?

And forgotten that the bold Buccleuch
⁴Is keeper here on the Scottish side?

And have they e’en ta’en him, Kinmont Willie,
Withouten either dread or sear?

And forgotten that the bold Buccleuch
Can back a steed or shake a spear?

O were there war between the lands,
As well Ι wot that there is none,

Ι would slight Carlisle castle high,
Though it were builded of marble stone.

Ι would set that castle in a lowe,
And slockcn it with English blood!
'l'here's never a man in Cumberland
Should ken where Carlisle castle stood.

But since nae war's between the lands,
And there is peace, and peace should be,
