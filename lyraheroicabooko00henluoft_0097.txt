BALLADS 69

I’ll neither barm English lad or lass,
And yet the Kinmont freed shall bel '

THE MARCH

He has called him forty Marchmen bold,
Ι trow they were of his ain name,
Except Sir Gilbert Elliot, called
The Laird of Stobs‚ I mean the same.

He has called him forty Marchmen bold,
Were kinsmen to the bold Buccleuch;

With spur on heeI, and splent on spauld,
And gluves of green, and feathers blue.

There were five and five before them a',
Wi’ hunting-horns and bugles bright:

And five and five cam’ wi' Buecleuch,
Like warden’s men, arrayed for fight.

And five and five like a mason gang

That carried the ladders lang and hie3
And five and five like broken men3

And so they reached the Woodhouselee.

And as we crossed the 'Bateable Land,
When to the English side we held,

The first 0’ men that we met wi’,
Whae suld it be but fause Sakelde?

‘Where be ye gaun, ye hunters keen? ’
Quo’ {ause Sakelde3 ‘come tell t'o me l’
‘We go to hunt an English stag
Has trespassed on the Scots countrie.’
