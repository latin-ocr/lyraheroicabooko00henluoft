BALLADS 73

And a thousand men on horse and foot
Cam' wi' the keen Lord Scroope along.

Buccleuch has turned to Eden Waten

Even where it flowed irae bank to brim,
And he has plunged in wi' a' his band,

And safely swam them through the stream.

He turned him on the other side,
And at Lord Scroope his glove flung he:
‘If ye like na my visit in merrie England,
In fair Scotland come visit me Ι ⁷

All sore astonished stood Lord Scroope,
He stood as still as rock of stane;

He scarcely dared to trew his eyes,
When through the water they had gane.

‘He is either himsell a devil frae hell,
Or else his mother a witch maun be3

I wadna have ridden that wan water
For a' the gowd in Christentie.'

THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL

ATTEND you, and give ear awhile,
And you shall understand
Of a battle fought upon the seas
By a ship of brave command. ’
The sight it was so glorious
Men’s liearts it did ful-fill,
And it made them cry, ‘To sea, to sea,
With the Angel Gabriel 1'
