BALLADS

This lusty ship oi Bristol
Sai led out adventamus-ly
Against the iocs oi linglarul,
Her strength with them to try:
well victualled, rigged, and manned she was,
With good provision still,
Which made men cry, ‘To sea, to sea,
With the Angel Gabriel! '

The Captain, famous Netherway
(That was his noble name):

. The Master—he was called John Mines—

A mariner of fame:

The Gunner, Thomas Watson,
A man of perfect skill:

With many another valiant beart
In the Angel Gabriel.

They waving up and down the seas
Upon the ocean main,

‘It is not long ag0,' quoth they,
‘That England fought with Spain:
O would the Spaniard we might meet

Our stomachs to fulfil!
We would play him fair a noble bout
With our Angel Gabriel! ’

They had no sooner spoken

But straight appeared in sight
Three lusty Spanish vessels

Of warlike trirn and might;
