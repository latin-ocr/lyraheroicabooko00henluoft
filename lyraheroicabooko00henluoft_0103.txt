BALLADS 75

With bloody resolution
They thought our men to spilL

And they vowed that they would make a prize
Of our Angel Gabriel.

Our gallant ship had in her
Full forty fighting men:
With twenty piece of ordnance
We played about thern then,
With powder, shot‚ and bullets
Right well we worked our will,
And hot and bloody grew the fight
With our Angel Gabriel.

Our Captain to our Master said,
‘Take courage, Master bold! ²

Our Master to the seamen said,
‘Stand fast, my hearts of goldl'

Our Gunner unto all the rest,
‘Brave hearts, be valiant still!

Fight on, fight on in the defence
Of our Angel Gabriel! ⁷

We gave them such a broadsffle,
It smote their mast asunder,
And tore the bowsprit off their ship,
Which made the Spaniards wonder,
And caused them in sear to cry,
With voices loud and shrill,
‘Help, help, or sunken we shall be
By the Angel Gabriell'
