BALLADS 77

Then they fled into Cales,
Where lie they must and will

For sear lest they should meet again
With our Angel Gabriel.

We had within our English ship
But only three men slain,

And five men burt, the which I hope
Will soon be well again.

At Bristol we were landed,
And let us praise God still,

That thus hath blest our lusty hearts
And our Angel Gabriel.

XXXI
HELEN OF KIRKCONNELL

Ι stu I were where Helen lies,

Night and day on me she cries3

O that Ι were where Helen lies,
On fair Kirkconnell lea!

Curst be the heart that thought the thought,
And curst the hand that fired the shot‚
When in my arms burd Helen dropt,

And died to succour mel

O thinkna ye my heart was sair
When my love dropt down, and spak⁷ nae mair?
There did she swoon wi' meikle care,

On fair Kirkconnell lea.
