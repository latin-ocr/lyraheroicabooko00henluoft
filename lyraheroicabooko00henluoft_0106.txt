BALLADS

As 1 went down the water side,

None but my foe to be my gnide,

None but my soe to be my gulde
On fair Kirkconnell lea;

Ι lighted down my sword to draw,
I hacked him in picces sma',
I hacked him in pieces sma'

For her sake that died for me.

O Helen fair beyond compare!

I'll mak' a garland o' thy hair,

Shall bind my heart for evermair,
Until the day I dee!

O that I were where Helen lies!

Night and day on me she cries;

Out of my bed she bids me rise,
Says, ‘Haste, and come to me!’

O Helen fair! O Helen chaste!

If 1 were with thee I were blest,

Where thou lies low and takes thy rest,
On fair Kirkconnell lea.

Ι wish my grave were growing green,
A winding-sheet drawn ower my e'en,
And I in Helen’s arms lying

On fair Kirkconnell lea.

I wish 1 were where Helen liesl
Night and day on me she eries,
And I am weary of the skies

For her sake that died for me.
