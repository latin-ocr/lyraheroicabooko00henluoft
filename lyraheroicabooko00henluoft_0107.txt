THE TWA CORBIES

AS I was walking all alane,

I heard twa corbies making a mane:
The tane unto the tither say,

‘Where sall we gang and dine the day? ²

‘In behint yon auld fail dyke

I wot there lies a new-slain knight;

And naebody kens that he lies there

But his hawk, his hound‚ and his lady fair.

His hound is to the hunting gane,
His hawk to fetch the wild—fowl hame,
His lady's ta⁷en another mate,

Sae we may mak' our dinner sweet.

Ye'll sit on his white banse-bane,

And 1⁷11 pike out his bonny blue e'en:
Wi' ae look o’ his gowden hair

We' 11 theek our ‘nest when it grows bare.

Mony a one for him makes mane,

But nane sall ken where he is gane:

O’er his white hanes, when they are bare,
The wind sall blaw for evermair.'
