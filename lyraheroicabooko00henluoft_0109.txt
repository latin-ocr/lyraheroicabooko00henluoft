GRAY 81

Vocal no more, since Cambria’s fatal day,
To high-born Hoel's harp or soft Llewellyn's lay.

‘Cold is Cadwallo's tongue
That hushed the stormy main:
Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed:
Mountains, ye mourn in vain
Modred‚ whose magic song
Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head.
On dreary Arvon’s shore they lie
Smeared with gore and ghastly pale:
Far, far aloof the affrighted favens sail;
The famished eagle screams, and passes by.
Dear lost companions of my tuneful art,
Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes,
Dear as the ruddy drops that warm my beart,
Ye died amidst your dying country⁷s eries 1—
No more 1 weep. They do not sleep.
On yonder elisis, a grisly band,
I see them sit; they linger yet,
Avengers of their native land:
With me in dreadful harmony they join,
And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line.

‘Weave the warp and weave the woof
The winding-sheet of Edward's race:

Give ample roorn and verge enough
The characters of hell to trace.

Mark the year and mark the night

When Sevem shall re—echo with affright
