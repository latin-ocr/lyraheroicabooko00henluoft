82 GRAY

The shrieks of death through Berkeley’s rooi that ring,
Shrieks of an agonising king!

She-woh of France, with unrelenting fangs,
That tear’st the bowels of thy mangled mate,

From thee be born, who o’er thy country hangs
The scourge oi Hcaven! What teri-ors round him wait!
Amazement in his van, with Flight combined,

And Sorrow's iaded form, and Solitude behind.

‘Mighty victor, mighty lord,
Low on his funeral couch he lies!
No pitying beart, no eye, afford
A tear to grace his obsequies.
Is the sable warrior fled?
Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead.
The swarm that in thy noontide heam were born?
Gone to salute the rising mom.
Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the zephyr blows,
While proudly riding o’er the azure realm
In gallam trim the gilded vessel goes:
Youth on the prow and Pleasure at the heim:
Regardless oi the sweeping Whirlwind’s sway,
That hushed in grim repose expects his evening

prey.

‘F ill high the sparkling bow}‚
The rich repast prepare;

Reit οἱ a crown, he yet may share the feast:
Close by the regal chair

Fen 'l'hirst and Famine scow}

A baleiul smile upon their baffled guest.
