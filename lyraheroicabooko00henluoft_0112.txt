84 G RAY

‘Girt with many a baron bold
Sublime their starry fronts they rear 3
And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old
In bearded majesty, appear.
In the midst a form divine!
Her eye proclaims her οἱ the Briton-line:
Her lion-port, her awe-commanding iace
Attempered sweet to virgin grace.
What strings symphonious tremble in the air,
What strains of vocal transport round her play?
Hear from the grave, great Taliessin‚ hear 3
They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.
Bright Rapture calls and, soaring as she sings,
Waves in the eye of Heaven her many-coloured
wmgs.

‘The verse adorn again
Fierce War and faithful Love
And Truth severe, by §airy fiction drest.
In buskined measures move
Pale Grief and pleasing Pain,
With Horror, tyrant of the throbbmg breast.
A voice as 01 the cherub-choir
Gales from blooming Eden bear,
And distant warblings lessen on my ear
That lost in Iong futurity expire.
Fond impious man, think’st thou yon sanguine cloud,
Raised by thy breath, has quenched the orb of day?
To-morrow he repairs the golden ssood
And warms the nations with redoubled ray.
Enough for me: with joy 1 sec
