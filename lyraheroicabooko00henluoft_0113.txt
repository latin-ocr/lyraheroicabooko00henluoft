COWPER 85

The different doom our fatos assign:
Be thine Despair and sceptred Care,
To triumph and to die are mine.'
He spoke, and headlong from the mountain⁷s height

Deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night.
Gray.

THE ROYAL GEORGE

TOLL for the Brave!

The brave that are no more!
All sunl< beneath the wave
Fast by their native shore!

Eight hundred of the brave,
Whose courage well was tried,
Had made the vessel heel
And laid her on her side.

A land-breeze shook the shrouds
And she was overset3

Down went the Royal George
With all her crew complete.

Toll for the brave!

Brave Kempenfelt is gone3
His last sea-fight is fought,
His work of glory done.

It was not in the battle;

No tempest gave the shock;
She sprang no fatal leak,
She ran upon no rock.
