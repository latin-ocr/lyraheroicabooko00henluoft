COWPER

His sword was in its sheath,
His fingers held the nen,
When Kempcnselt u ent down
With twice four hundred men.

Weigh the vessel up

Once dreadcd by our roes!
And mingle with our cup
The tear that England owes.

Her timbers yet are sound‚

And she may float again

F ull charged with England's thunder,
And plough the distant main:

But Kempenfelt is gone,
His victories are o'er3

And·he and his eight hundred
Shall plough the wave no more.
