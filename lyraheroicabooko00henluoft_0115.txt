COWPER

‘Princess! if our aged eyes

Weep upon thy matchless wrongs,
'Tis because resentment ties

All the terrors of our tongues.

Rome shall perish,—write that word
In the blood that she has spilt3
Perish hopeless and abhorred‚
Deep in ruin as in guilt.

Rome, for empire far renowned,
Tramples on a thousand states;
Soon her pride shall kiss the ground,
Hark! the Gaul is at her gates!

Other Romans shall arise
Heedless of a soldier's name3

Sounds, not arms, shall win the prize,

Harmony the path to fame.

Then the progeny that springs
From the forests of our land,

Armed with thunder, clad with wings,

Shall a wider world command.

Regions Caesar never knew
Thy posterity shall sway3

Where his eagles never flew,
None invincible as they.'

Such the bard's prophetie words,
Pregnant with celestial fire,
Bending as he swept the ehords
Of his sweet but awful lyre.
