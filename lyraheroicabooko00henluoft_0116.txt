G RAHAM OF GARTMORE

She with all a monarch’s pride
F elt them in her bosom glow,
Rushed to battle, fought, and died,
Dying, hurled them at the foe:

‘Ruffians, pitiless as proud,
Heaven awards the vengeance due;
Empire is on us bestowed,
Shame and ruin wait for you.'

TO HIS LADY

lv doughty deeds my lady please
Right soon I'll mount my steed3
And strong his arm, and fast his seat
That bears {rae me the meed.
I'll wear thy colours in my cap
Thy picture at my heart;
And he that bends not to thine eye
Shall rue it to his smart!
Then tell me how to woo thee, Love;
O tell me how to woo thee!
For thy dear sake, nae care I'll take,
Tho’ ne'er another trow me.

If gay attire delight thine eye
l’ll dight me in array3

I'll tend thy chamber door all night,
And squire thee all the day.
