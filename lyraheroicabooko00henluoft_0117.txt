DIBDIN 89

If sweetest sounds can win thine ear
These sounds I'll strive to catch 3

Thy voice I'll steal to woo thysell‚
That voice that nane can match.

But if fond love thy heart can gain,
Ι never broke a vow;
Nae maiden lays her skaith to me,
I never loved but you„
For you alone 1 ride the ring,
For you I wear the blue 3
For you alone Ι strive to sing,
O tell me how to woo'.
Then tell me how to woo thee, Love3
O tell me how to woo thee!
For thy dear sake, nae care I’ 11 take,

Tho’ ne’er another trow me.
Gralzam qf Gartmore.

BLow high, blow low, let tempests tear
The mainmast by the board 5

My heart, with thoughts of thee, my dear,
And love well stored‚

Shall brave all danger, scorn all sear,
The roaring winds, the raging sea,

In hopes on shore to be once more
Safe mooted with thee!
