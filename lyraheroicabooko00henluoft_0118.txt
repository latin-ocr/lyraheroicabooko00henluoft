DIBDIN

Aloft while mountains high we go,
'l'he whistling winds that scud along,
And surges roaring from below,
Shall my signal be to think on thee,
And this shall be my song:

Blow high, blow low-—

And on that night, when all the crew‚
The memory of their former lives
O’er flowing cans of flip renem
And drink their sweethearts and their wives,
I'll heave a sigh and think on thee,
And, as the ship rolls through the sea,
The burden οἱ my song shall be:

Blow high, blow low—

THE PERFECT SAI LOR

HERE, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling,
The darling of our crew;

No more he'll hear the tempest howIing,
For death has broached him to.

His form was of the manliest beauty,
His heart was kind and solt,

Faithful‚ below, he did his duty,

But now he's gone alost.

Tom never from his word departed‚
His virtues were so rare,

His friends were many and true-hearted‚
His Poll was kind and fair3
