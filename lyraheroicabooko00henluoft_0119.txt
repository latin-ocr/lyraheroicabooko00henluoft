CURRAN

And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly,
Ah, many's the tirne and ost!

But mirth is turned to melancholy‚
For 'som is gone alost.

Yet shall poor Torn find pleasant weather‚
When He, who all commands,

Shall give, to call life’s crew together,
The word to pipe all hands.

Thus Death, who kings and tars despatches,

In vain Tom’s life has doHed‚
For, though his body's under hatches,

His soul has gone alost.

XXXIX
THE DESERTER

IF sadly thinking,

With spirits sinking,

Could more than drinklng
My cares compose,

A cure for sorrow

From sighs I'd borrow,

And hope to-morrow
Would end my woes.

But as in wailing

There's nought avaihng,

And Death unfailing
Will strike the blow,
