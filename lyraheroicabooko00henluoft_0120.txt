PRINCE HOARE

Then for that reason,

And for a season,

Let ns be merry
Before we go.

To joy a stranger,
A way-worn ranger,
In every danger
My course I’ve run;
Now hope all ending,
And Death betriending,
His last aid lending,
My cares are done:
No more a rover‚
Or hapless lover,
My griefs are over,
My glass runs low;
Then for that reason,
And for a season‚
Let us be merry

Before we go!
C urran.

THE ARETHUSA

COME, all ye jolly sailors bold,
Whose hearts are cast in honour’s mould,
While English glory 1 unfold,
Huzza for the Arethusa!
She is a {rigate tight and brave,
As ever stemmed the dashing wave;
