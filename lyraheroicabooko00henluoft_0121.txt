PRINCE HOARE 93

Her men are staunch
To their fav'rite launch,
And when the foe shall meet our fire,
Sooner than strike, we'll all expire
On board of the Arethusa.

'Twas with the spring fleet she went out
The English Channel to cruise about,
When four F rench sail, in show so stout
Bore down on the Arethusa.
The famed Belle Poule straight ahead did lie,
The Arethusa seemed to fly,
Not a sheet, or a tack,
Or a brace, did she slack;
Though the Frenehman laughed and thought it
stuff‚
But they knew not the handful of men, how tough‚
On board of the Arethusa.

On deck five hundred men did dance,
The stoutest they could find in France3
We with two hundred did advance
On board of the Arethusa.
Our captain hailed the Frenchman‚ ‘Ho! ’
The Frenchman then eried out ‘Hallo! ’
‘Bear down, d'ye see,
To our Admiral's leel ’
‘N 0, no‚‘ says the F renchmzm, ‘that can't be! ⁷
‘Then I must lug you along with me,’
Says the saucy Arethusa.
