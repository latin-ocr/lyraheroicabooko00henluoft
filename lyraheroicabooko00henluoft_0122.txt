BLAKE

The fight was off the Frenchman's land,
We forced thern back upon their strand,
For we fought till not a stick could stand
Of the ganam Arethusa.
And now we’ve driven the foe ashore
Never to fight with Britons more,
Let each fin his glass
'l'o his fav'rite lass;
A health to our captain and Officers true,
And all that belong to the jovial crew
On board of the Arethusa.

Prince Hoare.

THE BEAUTY OF TERROR

Tmm, tiger, burning bright

In the forests of the night,

What immortal hand or eye

Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thinc eyes?

On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?

And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? and what dread feet?
