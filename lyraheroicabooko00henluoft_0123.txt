. BURN S 95

What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy hrain?

W hat the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears‚
Did He smile His work to see?

Did He who made the lamb make thee?

Tiger, tiger‚ burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye

Dase {rame thy fearful symmetry?
Blake.

DEFIANCE

FAREWELL, ye dungeons dark and strong,
The wretch's destinie:

M‘Pherson⁷s time will not be long

On yonder gallows tree.

Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,
Sae dauntingly gaed he ;

He played a spring and danced it round,
Below the gallows tree.

Oh, what is death but parting breath P—
On monie a bloody plain

I’ve dared his face, and in this place

I scorn him yet again!
