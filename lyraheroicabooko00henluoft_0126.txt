BURNS

Untie these bands from off my hands,
And bring to me my sax-ord!

And there's no a man in all Scotland,
But 1¹11 brave him at a word.

I've lived a life of sturt and strife5
1 die by treacherie:

It burns my beart 1 must depart
And not avenged be.

Now farewell light, thou sunshine might,
And all beneath the sky!
May coward shame distain his name,

The wretch that dares not die!

Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,
Sac dauntingly gaed he;

He played a spring and danced it round,
Below the gallows tree.

THE GOAL OF LIFE

SHOULD auld acquaintance be {orgog
And never brought to min' ?

Should auld acquaintance be forgot‚
And days o' lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne,

We’n tak a cup 0’ kindness yet
For auld lang syne.
