BURNS

And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp,
And surely I'll be mine;

And we'll tak a cup 0' kindness yet
For auld lang syne.

We twa hae run about the braes,
And pu'd the gowans fine 3

But we've wandered mony a weary foot
Sin’ auld lang syne.

We twa hae paidled i’ the burn
From mornin' sun till dine3

But seas between us braid hae roared
Sin' auld lang syne.

And here’s a hand, my trusty fiere,
And gie’s a hand 0' thine3

And we’ll tak a right guid-willie waught
For auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne,

We'll tak a cup o’ kindness yet
For auld lang syne.

XLIV
BEFORE PARTING

Go fetch to me a pint o' wine,
An’ fill it in a silver tassie3
That Ι may drink before Ι go
A service to my bonnie lassie.
