BURNS

The boat rocks at the pier o’ Leith,

Fu’ loud the wind blaws {rae the serry,
The ship rides by the Berwick-law,

And 1 maun leave my bonnie Mary.

The trumpets sound, the banners fly,

The glittering spears are ranked ready,
The shouts ο· war are heard afar,

The battle closes thick and bloody5
But it’s no the roar o‘ sea or shore

Wad mak me langer wish to tarry,
Nor shout 0‘ war that’s heard afar,

It’s leaving thee, my bonnie Mary.

DEVOTION

O MARY, at thy wlndow be,
It is the wished, the trysted hour!
Those smiles and glauces let me see,
That mak the miser's treasurc poor.
How blythely wad I bide the stoure,
Α weary slave irae sun to sun,
Could Ι the rich reward secure,
The lovely Mary Morison!

Yestreen‚ when to the trembling string
The dance gaed through the lighted ha'‚
To thee my fancy took its wing,
1 sat, but neither heard or saw:
