BURNS

Tho' this was fair, and that was braw,

And yon the toast of a’ the toun,
I sighed, and said amang them a',
‘Ye are na Mary Morison.‘

O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace,
Wha for thy sake wad gladly die?
Or canst thou break that heart of his
Whase only faut is loving thee?
If love for love thou wilt na gie,
At least be pity to me shown!
A thought ungentle canna be
The thought o' Mary Morison.

TRUE UNTIL DEATH

ΙΤ was a' for our rightfu' King,
We left fair Scotland's strand 3
It was a' for our rightfu' King
We e’er saw Irish land,
My dear,
We e'er saw Irish land.

Now a' is do'ne that men can do,
And a' is done in vain;
My love and native land farewell,
For I maun cross the main,
My dear,
For I maun cross the main.
