WORDSWORTH 101

She must espouse the everlasting Sea.

And what if she had seen those glories fade,
Those titles vanish, and that strength decay5

Yet shall some tribute of regret bc paid

When her long life hath reached its final day:
Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade
Of that which once was great is passed away.

XLVIII

DESTINY

IT is not to be thought of that the F lood

Of British freedom, which, to the open sea

Of the world⁷s praise, from dark antiquity

Hath flowed, ‘with pomp of waters, unwithstood,'
Roused though it be full often to a mood

Which spurns the check of salutary hands,

That this most famous stream in bogs and sands
Should perish,· and to evil and to good

Be lost for ever. In our halls is hung

Armoury of the invincible Knights of old:

We must be free or die, who speak the tongue
That Shakespeare spake 3 the saith and morals hold
Which Milton held. In everything we are sprung
Of Earth’s first blood, have titles manifold.

XLIX
THE MOTHERLAND

WHEN I have borne in memory what has tamed
Great Nations‚ how ennobling thoughts depart
