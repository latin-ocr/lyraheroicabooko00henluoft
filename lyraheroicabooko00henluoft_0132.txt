102 WORDSWOR'I'H

When rnen change swords ior ledgers, and desert
The student's bower for gold, some {ears unnamed
I had, my Country z—am 1 to be blamed?

But when I think οἱ thee, and what thou art,
Verily, in the bottom of my heart,

Of those unfilial {ears 1 am ashamed.

But dearly must we prize thee 3 we who find

In thee a bulwark for the cause of men3

And I by my affection was beguiled.

What wonder if a Poet now and then,

Among the many movements ol his mind,

Felt sor thee as a lover or a child!

L
IDEAL

MmroN! thou shouldst be living at this honr:
England hath need of thee: she is a fen

Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,
Fireside, the heroic wealth ol hall and bower‚
Have forfeited their ancient English dower
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men3
Oh! raise us up, return to us agaim

And give us manners, virtue, lroedom, power.
Thy soul was like a Stat, and dwelt apart:
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,

So didst thou travel on lise‘s common way,

In cheerful godliness3 and yet thy heart

The lowliest duties on itself did lay.
