104 WORDSWORTH

1, loving freedom, and untried3
No spor· of every random gust,
Yet being to myself a guide,
Too blindly have reposed my trust:
And oft, when in my heart was heard
Thy timely mandate, 1 deserred
The task, in smoother walks to stray3
But thee Ι now would serve more strictly, if 1 may.

Through no disturbance of my soul

Or strong compunction in me wrought,

Ι supplicate for thy control;

But in the quietngess of thought:

Me this unchartered freedorn tires;

1 feel the weight of chance-desires:

My hopes no more must change their name,
Ι long for a repose that ever is the same.

Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear
The Godhead's most benignant grace ς
Nor know we anything so fair
As is the smile upon thy face:
F lowers laugh before thee on their beds
And fragrance in thy footing treads3
Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong ;
And the most ancient heavens, through thee, are
fresh and strong.

To humbler functions, awful Power!
Ι call thee: Ι rnyself commend
Unto thy guidance from this hour;
O let my wcakuess have an end!
