WORDSWORTH 105

Give unto me, made lowly wise,
The spirit of sels—sacrifice3
The confidence of reason give3
And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live!

Ln
TWO VICTORIES

1 SAID, when evil men are strong,

No life is good, no pleasure long,

A weak and cowardly untruth!

Our Clifford was a happy Youth‚

And thankful through a weary time
That brought him up to manhood⁷s prime.
Again he wanders forth at will,

And tends a flock from hill to hill:
His garb is humble3 ne’er was seen
Such garb with such a noble mien;
Among the Shepherd grooms no mate
Hath he, a Child οἱ strength and state!
Yet lacks not friends for simple glee,
Nor yet for higher sympathy.

To his side the {allow-deer

Came, and rested without fear3

The eagie, lord of land and sea,
Stooped down to pay him sealty;

And both the undying fish that swim
Through Bowscale-Tarn did wait on him;
The pair were servants of his eye

In their immortality3
