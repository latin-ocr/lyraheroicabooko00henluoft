106 WORDSWORT H

And glancing‚ gleaming, dark or bright,
Moved to and fro, for his delight.

He knew the rocks which Angels haunt
Upon the mountains visitant;

He hath kenned them taking wing:
And into caves where F aeries sing

He bath entered; and been told

By Voices how men lived of old.
Among the heau-ens his eye can see
The face of thing that is to be3

And, if that men report him right,

His tongue could whisper words of might.
Now another day is come,

F itter hope, and nobler doom;

He hath thrown aside his crook,

And hath buried deep his book3
Armour rusting in his halls

On the blood of Clifford calls:

‘Quell the Seot! ' exclaims the Lance3
‘Bear me to the heart of France‚’

Is the longing of the Shield;

Tell thy name, thou trembling field ς

F ield of death, where‘er thou be,
Groan thou with our victory!

Happy day, and mighty hour,

When our Shepherd in his power,
Mailed and horsed, with lance and sword,
To his ancestors restored

Like a reappearing Stat,

Like a glory from afar,

F irst shall head the flock of war!
