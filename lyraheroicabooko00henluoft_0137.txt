IN MEMORIAM

NELSON Σ PITT : FOX

To mute and to material things
New life revolving summer brings;
The genial call dead Nature hears,
And in her glory reappears.
But O my Country's wintry state
What second spring shall renovate?
What powerful eall shall bid arise
The buried warlike and the wise3
The mind that thought for Britain's weal,
The hand that grasped the vietor steel?
The vernal sun new life bestows
Even on the meanest flower that blows;
But vainly, vainly may he shine,
Where glory weeps o’er NELSON'S shrine3
And vainly pierce the solemn gloom,
That shrouds‚ O PITT, thy hallowed tomb!

Deep graved in every British beart,
O never let those names depart!
Say to your sons‚—Lo‚ here his grave,
Who victor died on Gadite wave 3
To him, as to the burning levin,
Short, bright, resistless course was given.
Where'er his country's foes were found
Was heard the fated thunder's sound,
Till burst the bolt on yonder shore,
Rolled, blazed‚ destroyed,—and was no more.
