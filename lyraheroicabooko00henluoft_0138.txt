SCOTT

Nor mourn ye less his peris-hed worth,
Who bade the conqueror go forth,
And launched that thunderbolt of war
On Egypt, Hafnia, 'l'rafalgar5
Who, born to guide such high emprise,
For Britain’s weal was early wise;
Alas! to whom the Almighty gave,
For Britain⁷s sins, an early grave!
His worth, who in his mightiest bour
A baublc held the pride of power,
Spurned at the sordid lust of pell,
And served his Albion for herself3
Who, when the frantie crowd amain
Strained at subjection‘s bursting rein,
O’er their wild mood full conquest gained,
The pride he would not crush restrained,
Showed their fierce zeal a worthier cause,
And brought the freeman’s arm to aid the free·

man‘s laws.

Hadst thou but lived, though stripped of power,
A watchman on the lonely tower‚
Thy thrilling trump had roused the land,
When fraud or danger were at hand 3
By thee, as by the bencon-light,
Our pilots had kept course aright 3
As some proud column, though alone,
Thy strength had propped the tottering throne:
Now is the stately column broke,
The beacon-light is quenched in smoke,
