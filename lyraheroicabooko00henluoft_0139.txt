SCOTT 109

The trumpet’s silver sound is still,
The warder silent on the hill!

O think, how to his latest day,
When death, just hovering, claimed his prey,
With Palinure's unaltered mood
F irm at his dangerous post he stood 3
Each call for needful rest repelled‚
With dying hand the rudder held,
Tin in his fall with fateful sway,
The steerage of the realm gave way!
Then, while on Britain's thousand plains
One unpolluted chureh remains,
Whose peaceful bells ne’er sent around
The bloody toesin⁷s maddening sound,
But still, upon the hallowed day,
Convoke the swains to praise and pray3
While saith and civil peace are deas,
Grace this cold marble with a tear,—
He, who preserved them, Prrr, lies here!

Nor yet suppress the generous sigh,
Because his rival slumbers nigh;
Nor be thy requiescat dumb,
Lest it be said o’er Fox's tomb.
For talents mourn‚ untimely lost,
When best employed, and wanted most 3
Moum genius high, and lore profound,
And wit that loved to play, not wound;
And all the reasoning powers divine,
To penetrate, resolve, combine 3
