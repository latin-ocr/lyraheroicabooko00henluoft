And feelings keen, and fancy’s glow,—
They sleep with him who sleeps below:
And, if thou mourn'st they could not save
From error him who owns this grave,

Be every harsher thought suppressed,

And sacred be the last long rest.

Here, where the end os earthly things
Lays heroes, patriots, bards, and kings;
Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue,
Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung;
Here, where the fretted aisles prolong
The distant notes of holy song,

As if some angel spoke agen,

‘All peace on earth, good-will to men' 3
If ever from an English heart,

O, ltere let prejudice depart,

And, partial feeling cast aside,

Record, that Fox a Briton died!

When Europe crouched to F rance’s yoke,
And Austria beot, and Prussia broke,

And the firm Russian’s purpose brave
Was bartered by a timorous slave,

Even then dishonour’s peace he spurned,
The sullied olive-branch returned,

Stood for his country’s glory fast,

And nailed her colours to the mast!
Heaven, to reward his firmness, gave

A portion in this honoured grave,

And ne’er held marble in its trust

Οἱ two such wondrous men the dust.
