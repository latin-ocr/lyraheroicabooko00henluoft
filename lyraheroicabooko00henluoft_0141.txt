SCOTT 111

With more than mortal powers endowed‚
How high they soared above the crowd!
Theirs was no common party race,
Jostling by dark intrigue for place3
Like fabled Gods, their mighty war
Shook realms and nations in its jar 3
Beneath each banner proud to stand,
Looked up the noblest of the land,

Till through the British world were known
The names of Pm· and Fox alone.

Spells of such force no wizard grave

E‘er framed in dark Thessalian cave,
Though his could drain the ocean dry,
And force the planets from the sky.

These spells are spent, and, spent with these
The wine of life is on the lees.

Genius, and taste, and talent gone,

For ever tombed beneath the stone,
Where—taming thought to human pride !—
The mighty chiefs sleep side by side.
Drop upon Fox's grave the tear,

'Twill triekle to his rival's bier3

O’er Pm’s the mournful requiem sound,
And Fox’s shall the notes rebound.

The solemn echo seems to cry,—

‘Here let their discord with them die.
Speak not for those a separate doom
Whom fate made Brothers in the tomb5
But search the Iand of living men,

Where wilt thou find their like agen? '
