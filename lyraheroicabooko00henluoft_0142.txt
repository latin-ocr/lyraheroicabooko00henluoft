LIV

LOCHINVAR

Ο, γουκω Lochinvar is come out οἱ the west,
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
And save his good broadsword he wcapons had none.
He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone.

So faithful in love and so dauntless in war,

There never was knight like the young Lochiuvar.

He staid not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
But ere he alighted at Netherby gale,

The bride had consented, tlie gallant came late 3

For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,

Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.

So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall,

Among bride’s-men‚ and kinsmen, and brothers, and
all:

Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,

(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word‚)

‘O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,

Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?’

‘1 long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied3
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide3
And now am 1 come with this lost love oi mine

To lead but one measure, drink one cup oi wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar!
