114 SCOTT

There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,

But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see.

So daring in love and so daunrless in war,

Have ye e’er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?

Tm: MARCH

NExT morn the Baron climbed the tower,
To view afar the Scottish power
Encamped on Flodden edge:
The white pavilions made a show,
Like remnants of the winter snow,
Along the dusky ridge.
Long Marmion looked: at length his eye
Unusual movement might descry
Amid the shifting lines:
The Scottish host drawn out appears,
For flashing on the hedge of spears
The eastern sunbeam shines.
Their front now deepening, now extending ς
Their flank inclining, wheeling, bending,
Now drawing back, and now descending,
The skilful Marmion well could knOW,
They watched the motions of some foe
Who traversed on the plain below.

Even so it was. From Flodden ridgc
The Scots beheld the English host
Leave Barmore-wood, their evcning post,
