SCOTT

What checks the fiery sonl of James?
Why sits that champion of the dames
Inactive on his stccd,
And sees between him and his land,
Between him and 'l‘wecd‘s southern strand,
His host Lord Surrey lead?
What ’vails the vain knight-errant's brand?
O, Douglas‚ for thy leading wand!
Fierce Randolph, for thy speed!
O for one hour of Wallace wight,
Or well-skilled Bruce, to rule the right,
And cry ‘Saint Andrew and our right! ’
Another sight had seen that morn,
From Fate’s dark book a leaf been torn,
And F lodden had been Bannockburn!
The precious hour has passed in vain,
And England‘s host has gained the plain ;
Wheeling their march, and circling stin,
Around the base of F lodden hill.

THE A'I'I'ACK

‘Bu-r see! look up—on Flodden bent

The Scottish foe has fired his tent.’
And sudden, as he spoke,

From the sharp ridges of the hill,

All downward to the banks of Till
Was wreathed in sable smoke.

Volumed and fast, and rolling far,

The cloud enveloped Scotland’s war,
As down the hill they broke3
