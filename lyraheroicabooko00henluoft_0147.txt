SCOTT 117

Nor martial shout nor minstrel tone

Announced their march 3 their tread alone,

At times one warning trumpet blown,
At times a stifled hum,

Told England, from his mountain-throne
King James did rushing come.

Scarce could they hear, or see their foes‚
Until at weapon-point they close.

They close in clouds of smoke and dust‚

With sword-sway and with lance's thrust3
And such a yell was there

Of sudden and portentous birth,

As if men fought upon the earth

And fiends in upper air;

Ο life and death were in the shout,

Recoil and rally, charge and mut,
And triumph and despair.

Long looked the anxious squires; their eye

Could in the darkness nought descry.

At length the freshening western blast
Aside the shroud of battle cast3
And first the ridge of mingled spears
Above the brightening cloud appears;
And in the smoke the pennons ssew,
As in the storm the white sea-mew.
Then marked they, dashing broad and far,
The broken billows of the war,
And plumed crests oi chieftains brave
Floating like foarn upon the wave 3
But nought distinct they see:
