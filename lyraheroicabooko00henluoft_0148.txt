Wide raged the battle on the plain3

Spears shook, and falchions nashed amain3

Fen England's arrow-flight like Γαίης

Crests rose, and stoope‹l‚ and rose again,
Wild and disorderly.

Amid the scene of tumult, high

They saw Lord Marmion’s falcon fly:

And stainless Tunstall's banner white

And Edmund Howard's lion bright

Still bear them bravely in the fight:
Although against them come

Of gallant Gordons many a one,

And many a stubborn Badenoch—man,

And many a rugged Border elan,

With Huntly and with Home.

Far on the left, unseen the while,
Stanley broke Lennox and Argyle ς
Though there the western mountaineer
Rushed with bare bosom on the spear,
And flung the feeble targe aside,
And with both hands the broadsword plied.
’Twas vain: but Fortune, on the right,
With fickle smile cheered Scotland’s fight.
Then fell that spotless banner white,
The Howard’s lion fell3
Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew
With wavering ssight, while fiercer grew
Around the battle-yell.
The Border slogan rent the sky!
A Home! a Gordon! was the cry:
