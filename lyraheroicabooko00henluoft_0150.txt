120 SCOTT

The English shafts in volleys hailed,

In headlong charge their horse assailed3

Front, ssank, and rear, the squadrons sweep

To break the Scottish circle ‹lc-ep
That fought around their King.

Though charging knights like whirlwinds g0,

Though bill-men ply the ghastly blow,
Unbroken was the ring ;

The stubborn spear-men still made good

Their dark impenetrable wood,

Each stepping where his comrade stood,
The instant that he fell.

No thought was there of dastard slight 3

Linked in the serried phalanx tight‚

Till utter darkness closed her wing

O'er their thin host and wounded King.

Then skilful Surrey’s sage commands

Led back from strile his shattered bands;

And from the charge they drew,

As mountain waves from wasted lands
Sweep back to ocean blue.

Then did their loss his foemen know ;

They melted from the field, as snow,

When streams are swoln and south winds blow,
Dissolves in silent dew.

Tweed’s echoes heard the ceaseless plasb,
While many a broken band
