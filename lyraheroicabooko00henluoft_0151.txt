SCOTT

Disordered through her currents dash,
To gain the Scottish land3

To town and tower‚ to town and dale,

'l'o tell red Flodden’s dismal tale,

And raise the universal wail.

Tradition‚ legend, tune, and song

Shall many an age that wail prolong:

Stin from the sire the son shall hear

Of the stern Strife and carnage drear
Of Flodden’s fatal field,

Where shivered was fair Seotland's spear,
And broken was her shield!

LVI

THE CHASE

THE stag at eve had drunk his fill,

Where danced the moon on Monan’s rill,
And deep his midnight lair had made

In lone Glenartney's hazel shade;

But, when the sun his beaeon red

Had kindled on Benvoirlich's head,

The deep-mouthed bloodhound's heavy bay

Resonnded up the rocky way,
And faint from farther distance borne
Were heard the clanging hoof and 110111.

As Chief, who hears his warder call,
‘To arms! the foemen storm the wall,’

' The antlered monarch of the waste

Sprang from his heathery couch in haste.
