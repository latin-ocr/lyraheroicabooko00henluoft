SCOTT

But, ere his {leet career he took,

'l'he dew-drops from his flanks he shook3
Like crested leader proud and high,
Tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky 3

A moment gazed adown the dale,

A moment snuffed the tainted gale,

A moment listened to the cry

That thickened as the chase drew nigh;
Then, as the headmost foes appeared,
With one brave bound the eopse he cleared,
And, stretching forward free and far,

Sought the wild heaths of Uam·Va.r.

Yelled on the view the opening pack3
Rock, glen, and cavern paid them back:
To many a mingled sound at once

The awakened mountain gave response.
A hundred dogs bayed deep and strong,
Clattered a hundred steeds along,
Their peal the merry horns rang out,

A hundred voices joined the shout3
With hark and whoop and wild halloo
No rest Benvoirlich’s echoes knew.

Far from the tumult ssed the roe,

Close in her covert cowered the doe,
The falcon from her cairn on high

Cast on the rout a wondering eye,

'l'ill far beyond her piercing ken

The hurricane had swept the glen,
Faint and more faint, its failing din
Returned from cavern‚ cliff, and linn,
