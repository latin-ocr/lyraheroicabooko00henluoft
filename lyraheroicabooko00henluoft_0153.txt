SCOTT

And silence settled wide and still
On the lone wood and mighty hill.

Less loud the sounds of silvan war
Disturbed the heights of Uam-Var,
And roused the cavern where, ’tis told,
A giant made his den oi old3

For ere that steep ascent was won,
High in his pathway hung the sun,
And many a gallam, stayed perforce,
Was fain to breathe his faltering horse,
And of the trackers of the deer

Scarce half the lessening paek was near 3

So shrewdly on the mountain—side
Had the bold burst their mettle tried.

The noble stag was pausing now
Upon the mountain’s southern brow,

. Where broad extended, far beneath,

The varied realms of fair Menteith.
With anxious eye he wandered o'er
Mountain and meadow, moss and moor,
And pondered refuge from his toil

By far Lochard or Aberfoyle.

But nearer was the copsewood grey
That waved and wept on Loch-Achray,
And mingled with the pine-trees blue
On the bold cliffs of Benvenue.

Fresh vigour with the hope returned,
With fiying foot the heath he spurned,
Held westward with unwearied race,
And left behind the panting chase.
