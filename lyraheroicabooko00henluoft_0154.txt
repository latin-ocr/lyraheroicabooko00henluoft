’Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er,
As swept the hunt through Cambus-more3
What rcins were tightcned in despair,
When rose Benledi’s ridge in air3

Who ssagged upon Bochastle's heath,
Who shunned to stem the ssooded Teith‚
For twice that day froin shore to shore
The gallant stag swam stoutly o’er.

Few were the stragglers‚ following far,
That reached the lake oi Vennachar3
And when the Brigg oi 'rurk was won,
The headmost horseman rode alone.

Alone, but with unbated zeal,

That horseman plied the scourge and steel;
For jaded now and spent with toil,
Embossed with {oain and dark with soil,
While every gasp with sobs he drew,

The labouring stag strained full in view.
Two dogs oi black Saint Hubert's breed,
Unmatched for contage, breath, and speed,
Fast on his flying traces came

And all but won that desperate game;

For scarce a spear's length from his haunch
Vindictive toiled the bloodhounds staunch;
Nor nearer might the dogs attain,

Nor farther might the quarry strain.

Thus up the margin οἱ the lake,

Between the precipice and brake,

O’er stock :ind rock their race they take.
