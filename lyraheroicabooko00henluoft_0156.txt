SCOTT

‘I little thought, when first thy rein

I slacked upon the banks of Seine,

That Highland engle e'er should seed
On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed!
Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,
That costs thy life, my gallant grey! '

Then through the dell his horn resounds,
From vain pursuit to call the hounds.
Back limped with slow and crippled pace
The sulky leaders of the chase;

Close to their master’s side they pressed,
With drooping tail and humbled erest ς
But still the dingle's hollow throat
Prolonged the swelling bugle—note.

The owlets started from their dream,
The eagles answered with their scream,
Round and around the sounds were cast,
Till eehoes seemed an answering blast;
And on the hunter hied his way,

To Join some comrades of the day.

THE OUTLAW

O, BchAu, banks are wild and fair,
And Greta woods are green,

And you may gather garlands there
Wonld grace a summer queen.
