PIBROCH

PIBROCH of Donuil Dhu,
Pibroch of Donuil,
Wake thy wild voice anew,
Summon Clan-Conuil.
Come away, come away,
Hark to the summons!
Come in your war array,
Gentles and commons.

Come from deep glen and
From mountains so rocky,

The war-pipe and pennon
Are at Inverlocky.

Come every hill-plaid and
True heart that wears one,

Come every steel blade and
Strong hand that bears one.

Leave untended the herd,
The floek without shelter;

Leave the corpse uninterred,
The bride at the altar;

Leave the deer, leave the steer,

Leave nets and barges:
Come with your fighting gear,
Broadswords and targes.
