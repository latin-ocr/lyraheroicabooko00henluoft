Come as the winds come when
Forests are rended,

Come as the wavcs corne when
Navies are stranded:

Faster come, faster come,
F aster and faster,

Chief, vassal, page and groom,
Tenant and master.

Fast they come, fast they come ;
See how they gather!

wide waves the eagle plume
Blended with heather.

Cast your plaids, draw your blades‚
F orward each man set!

Pibroch of Donuil Dhu,
Knell for the onset!

THE OMNIPOTENT

‘Wuv sitt’st thou by that ruined hall,
'l'hou aged carle so stem and grey?
Dost thou its former pride recal1,
Or ponder how it passed away? '

‘Know'st thou not me? ’ the Deep Voice cried5
‘So long cnjoyed, so often misused,

Altcmate, in thy fickle pride,
Desired, neglected, and accused!
