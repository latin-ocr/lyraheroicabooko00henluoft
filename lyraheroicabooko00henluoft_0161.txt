SCOTT 131

Before my breath‚ like blazing flax,
Man and his marvels pass away!
And changing empires wane and wax,
Are founded, flourish‚ and decay.

Redeem mine hours-the space is brief-
While in my glass the saud-grains shiver,
And measureless thy joy or grief,
When T IME and thou shalt part for ever! ’

THE RED HARLAW

THE herting loves the merry moonlight,
The mackerel loves the wind,

But the oyster loves the dredging sang,
For they come of a gentle kind.

Now haud your tongue, baith wife and carle,
And listen‚ great and sma',

And Ι will sing of Glenallan’s Earl
That fought on the red Harlaw.

The cronach’s cried on Bennachie,
And doun the Don and a’,

And hieland and lawland may mournfu⁷ be
For the sair field of Harlaw.

They saddled a hundred milk-white steeds‚
They hae bridled a hundred black,

With a chafron of steel on each horse’s head
And a good knight upon his back.
