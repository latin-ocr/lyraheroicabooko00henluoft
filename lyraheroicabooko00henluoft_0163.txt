SCOTT 133

My horse shall ride through ranks sae rude,
As through the moorland sern,

Then ne’er let the gentle N orman blude
Grow cauld for Highland kerne.’

F AREWELL

FAREWELL! F arewell! the voice you hear
Has left its last soft tone with you3

Its next must join the seaward cheer,
And shout among the shouting crew.

The accents which I scarce could form
Beneath your frown’s controlling check‚
Must give the word, above the storm,
To cut the mast and clear the wreck.

The timid eye I dared not raise,

The hand that shook when pressed to thine,
Must point the guns upon the chase‚

Must bid the deadly cutlass shine.

To all I love, or hope, or sear,
Honour or own, a long adieu!

To all that life has soft and dear,
Farewell! save memory of you!
