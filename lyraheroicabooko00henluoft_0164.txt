BONNY DUNDEE

To the Lords oi Convention ’twas Claver’se who
‘Ere ῑῖἰιζὲἰῃςέ crown shall fall there are crowns to

So Ιεξίξέξκὲεἷναὶὶετ who loves honour and me,
Come follow the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.

Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can,

Come saddle your horses, and call up your mem
Come open the West Port, and let mc gang free,
And it's room for the bonnets οἱ Bonny Dundee ! ’

Dundee he is mounted, he rides up the street,

The bells are rung backward, the drums they are beat;
But the Provost, douce man, said, ‘Just e’cn let
The 32¹3?an is weel quit οἱ that Deil of Dundee.’

As he rode down the sanctified bends of the Bovv‚
Ilk carline was flyting and shaking her pow3

But the young plants of grace they looked couthie
Thinililggflffiek to thy bonnet, thou Bonny Dundee!

With sont-featured Whigs the Grassmarket was
crammed,

As if half the West had set tryst to be hanged;

There was spite in each look, there was sear in each e'e‚

As they watcbed {or the buum-ts of Bonny Dundee.
