SCOTT 135

These cowls of Kilmarnock had spits and had spears,
And lang-hafted gullies to kill Cavalier53
But they shrunk to close-hemis, and the causeway

was free,
At the toss of the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.

He spurred to the foot of the proud Castle rock,
And with the gay Gordon he gallantly spoke 3
‘Let Mons Meg and her marrows speak twa words

or three
For the love of the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.'

The Gordon demands of him which way he goes:
‘Where’er shall direct me the shade of Montrose!
Your Grace in short space shall hear tidings of me,
Or that low lies the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.

‘There are hills beyond Pentland‚ and lands beyond

If thgssg’tfflords in the Lowlands, there’s chiefs in

the North ;
There are wild Duniewassals three thousand times

three
Win cry lz'ozglz! for the' bonnet of Bonny Dundee.

There’s brass on the target of barkened bull-hide 3
There’s steel in the scabbard that dangles beside 3
The brass shall be burnished, the steel shall flash free

At a toss of the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.

Away to the hills, to the caves, to the rocks,

Ere Ι owe an usurper, I’ll conch with the fox;

And tremble, false W higs‚ in the midst of your glee,
You have not seen the last of my bonnet and me! ⁷
