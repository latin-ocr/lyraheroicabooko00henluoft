136 COLERIDGE

He waved his proud hand, and the trumpets were
u ‚

The ξὲῖῑίἲ-ἀῐυως clashed, and the horsemen rodeon,

Tin on Ravelston's cliffs and on Clermiston's lee

Died away the wild war-notes of Bonny Dundee.

Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can,
Come saddle the horses and call up the men,
Come open your gates, and let me gae free,
For it's up with the bonnets of Bonny Dundee!

ROMANCE

IN Xanadu did Kubla Khan

A stately pleasure-dome decree:

Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

Through caverns measureless to man

Down to a sunless sea.

So twice five miles of fertile ground

With walls and towers were girdled round:

And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hius,
Ensolding sunny spots of greenery.

But O! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedam cover!

A savage place! as holy and enchanted

As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted

By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
