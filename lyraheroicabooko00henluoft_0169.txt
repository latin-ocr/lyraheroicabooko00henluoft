To hear my voice amid the voice of birds,
When it was inarticulate as theirs,

Regard me mildly with her azure eyes.

So long a silence seemed the approach of death,
And like it. Once again she raised her voice.

And all your vows move not the Gods above,
When the knife strikes me there will be one prayer
The less to them: and purer can there be
