Any, or more fervent than the daughter's prayer
For her dear father’s safety and success?'

A groan that shook him shook not his resolve.

An aged man now entered, and without

One word, stept slowly on, and took the wrist

Of the pale maiden. She looked up, and saw

The fillet of the pricst and calm cold eyes,

'l'hen turned she where her parent stood, and cried‚

‘O father! grieve no more: the ships can sail!

SOLDIER AND SAILOR

I Lovn contemplating, apart
From all his homicidal glory,
The traits that soften to our beart

Napoleon’s story!

’Twas when his banners at Boulogne
Armed in our island every neeman,

His navy chanced to capture one
Poor British seaman.

They suffered him, I know not how,
Unprisoned on the shore to roam ;

And aye was bcnt his longing brow
On England's home.

His eye, methinks, pursued the flight
Of birds to Britain half—way over
With envy5 tltcy could reaeh the white

Dear cliffs of Dover.
