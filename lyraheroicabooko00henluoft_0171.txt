CAM PBELL

A stormy midnight warch, he thought,

Than this sojourn would have been dearer,
If but the storm his vessel brought

To England nearer.

At last, when care had banished sleep‚

ll

He saw one morning—-dreaming—doating,

An empty hogshead from the deep
Come shoreward floating3

He hid it in a cave, and wrought

The live-long day laboriou33 lurking
Until he launched a tiny boat

By mighty working.

Heaven help us! ’twas a thing beyond
Description‚ wretched: such a wherry
Perhaps ne’er ventured on a pond,
Or crossed a serry.

For ploughing in the salt-sea field,

‘It would have made the boldest shudder3
Untarred, uncompassed, and unkeeled‚

No sall—no rudder.

From neighb'ring woods he interlaced
His sorry skiff with wattled willows3
And thus equipped he would have passed

The foaming billows—

But Frenchmen caught him on the beach,
His little Argo sorely jeering;

Till tidings of him chanced to reach
Napoleon's hearing.
