CAMPBELL

With folded arms Napoleon stood,
Serene alike in peace and danger ;

And, in his wonted attitude,
Addressed the stranger:—

‘Rash man, that wouldst yon Channel pass
On twigs and staves so rudely fashioned3

Thy heart with some sweet British lass
Must be impassioned.‘

‘1 have no sweetheart‚' said the lad ;
‘But—absent long from one another—
Great was the longing that I had
To see my mother.’

‘And so thou shalt,’ Napoleon said,
‘Ye’ve both my favour fairly won3
A noble mother must have bred
So brave a son.’

He gave the tar a piece of gold,
And, with a flag of truce, commanded
He should be shipped to England Old,
And safely landed.

Our sailor oft could scantly shift
To find a dinner, plain and hearty;
But never changed the coin and gift
Of Bonaparte.
