‘ YE MARINERS ’

ΥΕ Mariners of England!

That guard our native seas 3

Whose flag has braved a thousand years
The battle and the breeze!

Your glorious standard launeh again
To match another foe!

And sweep through the deep,

While the stormy winds do blow3
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.

The spirits of your fathers

Shall start from every wave!

For the deck it was their field of fame,
And Ocean was their grave:

Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell
Your manly hearts shall glow,

As ye sweep through the deep,

While the stormy winds do blow;
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.

Britannia needs no bulwarks,

No towers along the steep 3

Her march is o’er the mountain-waves‚
Her home is on the deep.

With thunders from her native oak
She quells the floods belovv,
