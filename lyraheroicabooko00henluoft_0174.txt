CAMPBELL

As they roar on the shore,

When the stormy winds do blow;
When the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.

The meteor flag of England

Shall yet terrific burn;

Till danger’s troubled night depart,
And the stat οἱ peace return.

Then, then, ye ocean warriors!

Our song and feast shall flow

To the fame of your name,

When the storm has ceased to blow;
When the fiery fight is heard no more,
And the storm has ceased to blovv.

THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC

OF Nelson and the North

Sing the glorious day's renown‚

When to battle fierce came forth

All the might of Denmark’s crown,

And her arms along the deep proudly shone3
By each gun the lighted brand

In a bold determined hand,

And the Prince of all the land
Led them on.

Like leviathans afloat,
Lay their bulwarks on the brine ;
