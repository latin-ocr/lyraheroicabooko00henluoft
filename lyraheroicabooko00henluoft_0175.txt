CAMPBELL 145

While the sign of battle ssew

On the lofty British line:

It was ten of April morn by the chime:
As they drifted on their path,

There was silence deep as death ,-

And the boldest held his breath‚
For a time.

But the might of England flushed

To anticipate the seene;

And her van the fleeter rushed

O'er the deadly space between.

‘Hearts of oak! ' our captains cried3 when each
gun

From its adamantine lips

Spread a death-shade round the ships,

Like the hurricane eclipse
Of the sun.

Again! again! again!

And the havoc did not slack,

Till a feeble cheer the Dane,

To our cheering se'nt us back3—

Their shots along the deep slowly boom :--
Then eease—and all is wail,

As they strike the shattered sail3

Or, in conflagration pale

Light the gloom.

Now joy, Old England, raise

For the tidings of thy might,

By the festal cities’ blaze,

Whilst the wine-cup shines in light 3
