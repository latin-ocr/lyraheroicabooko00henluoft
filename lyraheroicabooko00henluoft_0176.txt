ELLIOTT

And yet amidst that joy and upton,
Let us think οἱ them that sleep

Full many a fathom deep

By thy wild and stormy steep,

Elsinore !
cannen.

LXVIII
BATI'LE SON G

DAv, like our souls‚ is fiercely dark;
What then? ’Tis day!

We sleep no more ; the cock crows—hark!
To arms! away!

They come! they come! the knell is rung
Of us or them;

Wide o‘er their march the pomp is flung
Of gold and gem.

What collared hound of lawless sway,
To famine dear,

What pensioned slave of Attila,
Leads in the rear?

Come they from Scythian wilds afar
Our blood to spill?

Wear they the livery of the Czar?
They do his will.

Nor tasselled silk, nor epaulette‚
Nor plume, nor torse—

No splendour gilds, all sternly met,
Our soot and horse.
