CUNNINGHAM 147

But, dark and still, we inly gIOW‚
Condensed in ire!

Strike, tawdry slaves, and ye shall know
Our gloom is fire.

In vain your pomp, ye evil powers,
Insults the land,-

Wrongs, vengeance, and tlte cause are ours‚
And God’s right hand!

Madmen! they trample into snakes
The wormy clod!

Like fire, beneath their feet awakes
The sword of God!

Behind‚ before, above, below,
They rouse the brave ;

Where'er they g0, they make a foe,

Or find a grave.
Elliott.

LXIX
LOYALTY

HAME, hame‚ hame‚ hame fain wad I be,

O hame‚ hame‚ hame‚ to my ain countrie!

When the flower is i’ the bud and the leaf is on the tree‚
The lark shall sing me hame in my ain countrie3
Hame, hame‚ hame‚ hame fain wad Ibe,

Ο hame‚ hame‚ hame‚ to my ain countrie!

The green leaf o’ loyaltie’s begun for to fa',

The bonnie white rose it is withering an' a',

But I'll water ’t wi’ the blude of usurping tyrannie,
An’ green it will grow in my ain countrie.
