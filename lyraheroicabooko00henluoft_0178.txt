148 CUNNINGHAM

Hame, hame, hame, hame fain wad I be,
O hamc, hame, hamc, to my ain countriel

The great are now gane, a' wha ventured to save;
'l'he new grass is springing on the tap o’ their grave:
But the sun thro’ the mirk blinks blythe in my e'e,
‘I’ll shine on ye yet in yere ain countrie.’

Hame, hame, hame, hame fain wad I be,

Hame, barne, barne, to my ain countrie!

A SEA-SON G

A wss‘r sheet and a flowing sea,
A wind that follows fast

And fills the white and rustling sail
And bends the gallant mast3

And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
While like the engle free

Away the good ship ssies, and leaves
Old England on the lee.

O sor a solt and gentle wind!
I heard a fair one cry3
But give to me the snoring breeze
And white waves heaving high;
And white waves heaving high, my lads,
The good ship tight and free—
'she world of waters is our home,
And merry men are we.
