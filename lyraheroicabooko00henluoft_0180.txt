150 BYRON

I never was on the dull, tame shore,

But I loved the great Sea more and more,

And baekwards flew to her billowy meast,

Like a bird that seeketh its mother's nest3
And a mother she was, and is to me;

For I was born on the open Sea!

The waves were white, and red the mom,

In the noisy bour when I was b0m3

And the whale it whistled‚ the porpoise rolled‚
And the dolphins bared their backs of gold 3
And never was heard such an outcry wild

As welcomed to life the Ocean-child!

I’ve lived since then, in calm and strife,

Full fifty summers a sailor's life,

With wealth to spend, and a power to range,
But never have sought, nor sighed for ehange3
And Death‚ whenever he come to me,

Shall come on the wide unbounded Sea! R·

That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
