BYRON 151

Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

For the Angel of De‘ath spread his wings on the blast‚
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed 3

And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew

still Ξ

And there lay the steed with his nostrii all wide,
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride:

And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turs,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.

And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mai13
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,

The lances unlffled, the trumpet unblown.

And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,

And the idols are broke in the temple of Batti,-

And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!

LXXIII
THE STORMING OF CORINTH

THE SIGNAL

THE night is past, and shines the sun
As if that mom were a jocund one.
Lightly and brightly breaks away

The Morning from her mantle grey,
And the noon will look on a sultry day.
