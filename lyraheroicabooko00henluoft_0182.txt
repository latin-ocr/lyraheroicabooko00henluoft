152 BYRON

Hark to the tmmp, and the dmm,
And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn,
And the ssap of the banners that ssit as they‘re borne,
And the neigh of the steed, and the multitude’s hum,

And the clash, and the shout, ‘They come! they ι

come! ’

The horsetails are plucked from the ground, and the
sword

From its sheath; and they form, and but wait for the
word.

Tartar, and Spahi‚ and Tureoman,

Strike your tents, and throng to the van;

Mount ye, spur ye, skirr the plain,

That the fugitive may flee in vain,

When he breaks from the town; and none escape,

Aged or young, in the Christian shape;

While your fellows on foot, in a fiery‘mass,

Bloodstain the breach through which they pass.

The steeds are all bridied, and snort to the reim

Curvecl is each neck, and flowing each mane ς

White is the foam of their champ on the bit:

The spears are uplifted; the matches are lit;

The cannon are pointed, and ready to roar,

And crush the wall they have crumbled before:

Forms in his phalanx each janizar;

Alp at their head; his right arm is bare,

So is the blade oi his scimitar;

The khan and the pachas are all at their post3

The vizier himself at the head of the host.

When the culverin’s signal is fired, then οὓς

Leave not in Corinth a living one—
