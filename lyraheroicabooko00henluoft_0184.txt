154 BYRON

Mingle there with the volleying thunder,
Which makes the distant cities wonder
How the sounding battle goes,

If with them, or for their foes5

Ii they must mourn, or may rejoice

In that annihilating voice,

Which pierees the deep hills through and through
With an echo dread and new:

You might have heard it, on that day,
O’er Salamis and Megara;

(We have heard the hearers say‚)

Even unto Piraeus’ bay.

From the point of encountering blades to the hut,
Sabres and swords with blood were gilt;

But the rampart is won, and the spoil begun‚
And all but the after carnage done.

Shriller shrieks now mingling come

From within the plundered dome:

Hark to the haste of flying feet

That splash in the blood oi the slippery street 3
But here and there, where ’vantage ground
Against the foe may still be found,

Desperate groups, of twelve or ten,

Make a pause, and turn again—

With banded backs against the wall,

Fiercely stand, or fighting fall.

There stood an old man—his hairs were white,
But his veteran arm was full oi might:
So gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,
