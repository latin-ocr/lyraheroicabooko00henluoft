BYRON

The dead before him, on that day,

In a semicircle lay;

Still he combated unwounded‚

Though retreating‚ unsurrounded.
Many a sear of former fight

Lurked beneath his corselet bright;
But of every wound his body bore,
Each and all had been ta'en before:
Though aged, he was so iron of limb,
Few of our youth could eope with him,

And the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,
Outnumbered his thin hairs of silver grey.

From right to left his sabre swept;
Many an Othman mother wept

Sons that were unborn, when dipped
His weapon first in Moslem gore,

Ere his years could count a score.

Of all he might have been the sire
Who fell that day beneath his ire:
For, sonless left long years ago,

His wrath made many a childless foe3
And since the day, when in the strait
His only boy had met his fate,

His parent’s iron hand did doom
More than a human hecatomb.

If shades by carnage be appeased,
Patroclus' spirit less was pleased
Than his, Minotti’s son, who died
Where Asia's bounds and ours divide.
Buried he lay, where thousands before

For thousands of years were inhumed on the shore ;
