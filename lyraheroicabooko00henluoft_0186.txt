What of them is left, to tell

where they lie, and how they fell?
Not a stone on their turi, nor a bone in their graves;
But they live in the verse that immortally saves.

THE MAGAZINE

Darkly, sternly, and all alone,

Minotti stood o’er the altar-stone:
Madonna's face upon him shone,

Painted in heavenly hues above,

With eyes of light and looks of love;

And placed upon that holy shrine

To fix our thoughts on things (livine,
When pietured there, we knccling see
Her, and the boy-God on her knee,
Smiling sweetly on each prayer

To heaven, as if to wast it there.

Still she smiled; even now she smiles,
Though slaughter streams along her aisles:
Minotti lifted his aged eye,

And made the sign of a cross with a sigh,
Then seized a torch which blazed thereby;
And still he stood, while with steel and flame
Inward and onward the Mussulman came.

The vaults beneath the mosaic stone
Contained the dead of ages gone3
'l'heir names were on the graven floor,
But now illegible with gore;

The carved crests, and curious hues
The varied marble's veins diffuse,
