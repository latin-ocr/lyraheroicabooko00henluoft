Were smemed, and slippery, stained, and strown
With broken swords and helms o’erthrown:
There were dead above, and the dead below
Lay cold in many a coffined row;
You might see them piled in sable state,
By a pale light through a gloomy grate 3

And stored along the vaulted graves
Her sulphurous treasures, thiekly spread
In masses by the fleshless dead:

For lack of further lives, to slake

And spoil the shrines of offerings rich,
And from each other’s rude hands wrest
