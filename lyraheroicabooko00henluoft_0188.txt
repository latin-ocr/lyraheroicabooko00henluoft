158 - BYRON

That mom it held the holy wine,

Converted by Christ to his blood so divine,
Which his worshippers (lrank at the break oi day,
To shrive their souis ere they joined in the stay.
Still a few drops within it lay;

And round the sacred table glow

Twelve lofty lamps, in splendid row,

From the purest metal cast;

A spoil—the richest‚ and the last.

So near they carne, the nearest stretched
To grasp the spoil he almost reached,
When old Minotti⁷s hand
Touched with the torch the train—
‘Tis fired!
Spire, vaults, the shrine, the spoil‚ the slain,
The turbaned victors, the Christian band,
All that of living or dead remain,
Hurl‘d on high with the shivered iane,
In one wild roar expired!
The shattered town—the walls thrown down—
The waves a moment backward bent—
The hills that shake, although unrent,
As if an earthquake passed—
The thousand shapeless things all driven
In cloud and flame athwart the heaven
By that tremendous blast—
Proclaimed the desperate conflict o’er
On that too long afflicted shore:
Up to the sky like rockets go
All that mingled there below:
