BYRON 159

Many a tall and goodly man,
Scorched and shrivelled to a span,
When he fell to earth again

Like a cinder strewed the plain:
Down the ashes shower like rain 3
Some fell in the gulf, which received the sprinkles
With a thousand circling wrinklesj
Some fell on the shore, but far away
Scattered o’er the isthmus lay3
Christian or Moslem, which be they?
Let their mother say and say!

When in cradled rest they lay,

And each nursing mother smiled

On the sweet sleep of her child,
Little deemed she such a day

Would rend those tender limbs away.
Not the matrons that them bore
Could discern their offspring more3
That one moment left no trace

More of human form or face

Save a scattered scaip or bone;

And down came blazing rafters, strown
Around, and many a falling stone,
Deeply dinted in the clay,

All blackened there and reeking lay.
All the living things that heard

That deadly earth-shock disappeared:
The wild birds fiew5 the wild dogs fied,
And howling left the unburied dead,·
The camels from their keepers broke 3
The distant steer forsook the yoke—
