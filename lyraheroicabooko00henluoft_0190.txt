BYRON

The neuter steed plunged o‘er the plain,

And burst his girth, and tore his rein;

'l'he bun-frog's note {rom out the marsh

Deep—mouthed arose, and doubly harsh;

The wolves yelied or. the caverned hill

Where echo rolled in thunder still;

The jackals’ troop in gathered cry

Bayed from afar complainingly,

With a mixed and moumsul sound,

Like crying babe, and beaten hound:

With sudden wing and ruffled breast

The eagle left his rocky nest,

And mounted nearer to the sun,

The clouds beneath him seemed so dun ;

Their smoke assailed his startled beak,

And made him higher soar and shriek—
Thus was Corinth lost and won!

ALHAMA

Tus Moorish Kiug rides up and down,
Through Granada’s royal town 3
From Elvira’s gates to those
Of Bivarambla on he goes.
Woe is me, Alhamal

Letters to the monarch tell
How Alhama‘s city fell:
In the fire the scroll he threw‚
And the messenger he slew.
Woe is me, Albama!
