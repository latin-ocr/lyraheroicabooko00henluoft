BYRON

He quits his mule, and mounts his horse,
And through the street direets his course 3
Through the street of Zacatin ·
To the Alhambra spurring in.

Woe is me, Alhamal

When the Alhambra walls he gained,
On the moment he ordained
That the trumpet straight should sound
With the silver clarion round.

Woe is me, Alhama!

And when the hollow drums of war

Beat the loud alarm afar,

That the Moors oi town and plain

Might answer to the martial strain—
Woe is me, Alhama!—

Then the Moors, by this aware,
That bloody Mars recalled them there
One by one, and two by two,
To a mighty squa'dron grew.
Woe is me, Alhama!

Out then spake an aged Moor
In these words the king before,
‘Wherefore call on us, O King?
What may mean this gathering? '
Woe is me, Alhama!

‘Friends! ye have, alas! to know
Of a most disastrous blow3
