That the Christians, stem and bold,
Have obtained Alhama's hold)
Woe is me, Alhamal

Out then spake old Alfaqui,

With his beard so white to see,

‘Good King! thou art justly sewed,

Good King! this thou hast deserved.
Woe is me, Albamal

By thee were slain‚ in evil hour,
The Abencerrage, Granada's flower;
And strangers were received by thee

Of Cordova the Chivalry.
Woe is me, Alhama!

And for this, Ο King! is sent
On thee a double chastisement:
Thee and thine, thy crown and realm,
One last wreck shall overwhelm.
Woe is me, Alhama!

He who holds no laws in awe,
He must perish by the law ς
And Granada must be won,
And thyself with her undone.’
Woe is me, Albamal

Fire ssashed {rom out the old Moor’s eyes,
The monarch's wrath began to rise,
Because he answered, and because

He spake exceeding well of laws.
Woe is me, Albama!
