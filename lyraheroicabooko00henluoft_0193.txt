BYRON

‘There is no law to say such things
As may disgust the ear of kings: '
Thus, snorting with his choler, said

The Moorish King, and doomed him dead.

Woe is me, Alhama!

Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui 1
Though thy heard so hoary be,
The King hath sent to have thee seized,
For Alharna’s loss displeased.
Woe is me, Alhama!

And to fix thy head upon

High Alhambra's loftiest stone3

That this for thee should be the law,

And others tremble when they saw.
Woe is me, Alhama!

‘Cavalier‚ and man of worth!
Let these words of mine go forth!
Let the Moorish Monarch know,
That to him I nothing owe.
Woe is me, Alhama!

But on my soul Alharna weighs,

And on my inmost spirit preys3

And if the King his land hath lost,

Yet others may have lost the most.
Woe is me, Alhama!

Sires have lost their children, wives
Their lords, and valiant men their lives!
