BYRON

One what best his love might claim
Hath lost, another wealth, or fame.
Woe is me, Albamal

Ι lost a damsel in that honr,

Of an the land the loveliest flower5

Doubloons a hundred 1 would pay,

And think her ransom chcap that day.’
Woe is me, Albamal

And as these things the old Moor said,
They severed from the trunk his head;
And to the Albambra’s wall with speed
’Twas carried, as the King decreed.
Woe is me, Alhamal

And men and infants therein weep
Their loss, so heavy and so deep ς
Granada‘s ladies, all she rears
Within her walls, burst into tears.

Woe is me, Alhama!

And from the windows o'er the walls
The sable web of mourning falls ς
The King weeps as a woman o'er
His loss, for it is much and sore.
Woe is me, Alhama!

And my bark is on the sea 3
But, before I go, 'I' om Moore,
Hcre’s a double health to thee!
