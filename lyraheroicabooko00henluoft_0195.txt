BYRON

Here’s a sigh to those who love me,
And a smile to those who hate;

And, whatever sky’s above me,
Here’s a heart for every fate.

Though the ocean roar around me,
Yet it still shall bear me on3

Though a desert should surround me,
It hath springs that may be won.

Were 't the last drop in the well,
As I gasped upon the brink,
Ere my sainting spirit fell„
'Tis to thee that I would drink.

With that water, as this wine,
The libation Ι would pour

Should be, ‘Peaee with thine and mine,

And a health to thee, Tom Moore! '

LXXVI
THE RACE WITH DEATH

O VEMCE! Venice! when thy marble walls
Are level with the waters‚ there shall be
A cry of nations o'er thy sunken halls,
A loud lament along the sweeping sea!
If Ι, a northern wanderer, weep for thee,

What should thy sons do ?—anything but weep:

And yet they only murmur in their sleep.
In contrast with their fathers—as the slime,
The dull green ooze of the receding deep,
