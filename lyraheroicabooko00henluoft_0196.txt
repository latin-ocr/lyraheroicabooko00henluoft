166 BYRON

Is with the dashing οἱ the spring-tide foam

That drives the sailor shiplcss to his horne,

Are they to those that were ; and thus they creep‚

Crouching and crab-like, through their sapping
streets.

Ο agony! that centuries should reap

No mellower harvest! 'l'hirteen hundred years

Of wealth and glory turned to dust and tears,

And every monument the stranger meets,

Church, palace, pillar, as a mourner greets;

And even the Lion all subdued appears,

And the harsh sound of the barbarian dmm

With dull and daily dissonance repeats

The echo of thy tyrant‘s voice along

The soit waves, once all musical to song,

'rhat heaved beneath the moonlight with the throng

Of gondolas and to the busy hum

Of cheerful creatures‚ whose most sinful deeds

Were but the overbeating of the heart,

And flow of too much happiness, which needs

The aid of age to turn its course apart

From the luxuriant and voluptuous ssood

Of sweet sensassons, battling with the blood.

But these are better than the gloomy errors,

The weeds oi nations in their last decay,

When Vice walks forth with her unsoftened terrors,

And Mirth is madness, and but smiles to slay3

And Hope is nothing but a false delay,

The sick man's lightening hali an hour ere death,

When Faintness, the last morta! birth oi Pain,

And apathy of limb, the dun beginning
