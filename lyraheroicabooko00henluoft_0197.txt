BYRON 167

Of the cold staggering race which Death is winning,
Steals vein by vein and pulse by pulse away 3

Yet so relieving the o'er-tortured clay,

To him appears renewal of his breath‚

And freedorn the mere numbness of his chain3

And then he talks of life, and how again

He feels his spirits soaring—albeit weak,

And of the fresher air, which he would seek:

And as he whispers knows not that he gasps,

That his thiu finger feels not what it clasp53

And so the film comes o'er him, and the dizzy
Chamber swims round and round, and shadows busy,
At which he vainly catcheS, flit and gleam,

Till the last rattle chokes the strangled scream,

And all is ice and blackness, and the earth

That which it was the moment ere our birth.

LXXVII
THE GLORY THAT WAS GREECE

THE isles of Greece‚ the isles of Greece!
Where burning Sappho loved and sung,

Where grew the arts of war and peace,
Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!

Eternal summer gilds thern yet,

But all except their sun is set.

The Scian and the Teian muse,
The hero's harp‚ the lover’s lute,
- Have found the farne your shores refuse:
Their place of birth alone is mute
