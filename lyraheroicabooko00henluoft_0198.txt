BYRON

To sounds which echo further west
Than your sires' ‘Islands oi the Blest)

The mountains look on Marathon—
And Marathon looks on the sea ;
And, musing there an honr alone,
1 dreamed that Greece might still be free3
For, standing on the Persians’ grave,
1 could not deem myself a slave.

A king sate on the rocky brow

Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
And ships by thousands lay below,

And men in nations;—all were his!
He. counted them at break of day,
And when the sun set, where were they?

And where are they? and where art thou,
My country? On thy voiceless shore
The heroic lay is tuneless ηοω,
The heroic bosom beats no more!
And must thy lyre, so long divine,
Degenerate into hands like mine?

'Tis something iu the dearth of fame,
Though linked among a iettered tace,
To feel at least a patriot’s shame,
Even as I sing, suffuse my sace5
For what is left the poet here?
For Greeks a blush, for Greece a tear!

Must we but weep o’er days more blest?
Must we but blush? Our fathers bled.

Earth! render back from out thy breast
A temnant of our Spartan dead!
