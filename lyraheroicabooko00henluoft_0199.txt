BYRON

Of the three hundred grant but three,
To make a new Thermopylae!

What, silent still? and silent all?
Ah! no: the voices of the dead
Sound like a distant torrent’s fall,
And answer, ‘Let one living head,
But one arise,—we come, we come! ’
’Tis but the living who are dumb.

In vain—in vain: strike other chords;
Fill high the cup with Samian wine!

Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
And shed the blood of Scio’s vine!

Hark! rising to the ignoble call,

How answers each bold Bacchanal!

You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet 3
Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
Of two such lessons, why forget
The nobler and the manlier one?
Y ou have the letters Cadmus gave ,-
Think ye he meant them for a slave?

Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
We will not think of themes like these!
It made Anacreon's song divine:
He served—but served Polycrates:
A tyrant3 but our masters then
Were still, at least, our countrymen.

The tyrant of the Chersonese

Was freedom’s best and bravest friend;
That tyrant was Miltiades!

Oh! that the present hour would lend
