BYRON

Another despot of the kind!
Such chains as his were sure to bind.

Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
On Suli's rock and Parga's shore
Exists the remnant oi a line
Such as the Doric mothers bore3
And there, perhaps, some seed is sown
The Heracleidan blood might own.

Trust not ior freedom to the Franks—
'I'hey have a king who buys and sells;
In native swords and native ranks
The only hope of eourage dwells:
But Turkish force and Latin fraud
Would break your shield, however broad.

Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
Our virgins dance beneath the shade—

I see their glorious black eyes shine3
But, gazing on each glowing maid,

My own the burning tear—drop laves,

To think such breasts must suckle slaves.

Plaee me on Sunium's marbled steep,
Where nothing save the waves and 1
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep ;
There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
A land oi slaves shall ne'er be mine-
Dash down yon cup of Samiam wine!
