BYRON 171

LXXVIII

HAIL AND FAREWELL

’T1s time this heart should be unmoved,
Since others it hath ceased to move:
Yet, though I cannot be beloved,
Still let me love!

My days are in the yellow leaf 3
The flowers and fruits of love are gone3
The worm, the canker, and the grief
Are mine alone!

The fire that 011 my bosom preys
Is lone as some volcanie isle3
No torch is kindled at its blaze—
A funeral pile.

The hope, the sear, the jealous care,
The exalted portion of the pain
-And power of love, Ι cannot share,
But wear the chain.

But 'tis not thus, and 'tis not here,
Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now

Where glory deeks the hero‘s bier,
Or binds his brow.

The sword, the banner, and the field,
Glory and Greeee, around me see!
The Spartan borne upon his shield
Was not more free.
