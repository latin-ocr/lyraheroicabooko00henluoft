172 WOLFE

Awake! (not Greece—she is awake !)
Awake, my spirit! Think through whom
Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake,
” And then strike home!

Tread those reviving passions down,
Unworthy manhood! unto thee
Indiflerent should the smile or frown
Of beauty be.

If thou regrett’st thy youth, why livet
The lad of honourable death
Is here: up to the field, and give
Away thy breath!

Seek out—less often sought than found—
A soldier's grave, for thee the best ς
Then look around, and choose thy ground,

And take thy rest.
Byron.

AFTER CORUNNA

NOT a drurn was heard, not a funeral note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried ς

Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O'er the grave where our hero we buried.

We buried him darkly at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning,

By the struggling moonbeam‘s misty light,
And the lantern dimly buming.
