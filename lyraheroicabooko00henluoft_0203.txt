WOLFE 173

No useless coffin enclosed his breast‚
Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him3
But he lay like a warrior taking his rest
With his martial cloak around him.

F ew and short were the prayers we said,
And we spoke not a word of sorrow3

But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,
And we bitterly thought of the morrow.

We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed
And smoothed down his lonely pillow,

How the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his

Anldezxxxfle' far away on the billow!

Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that’s gone,
And o’er his cold ashes upbraid him3

But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on
In the grave where a Briton has laid him.

But half of our heavy task was done,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring3
And we heard the distant and random gun
That the foe was sullenly firing.

Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh and gory3

We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone—
But we left him alone with his glory.
