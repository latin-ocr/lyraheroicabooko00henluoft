That ship there is a F renchman, who means to fight

And odds bobs, hammer and tongs, long as
I’ve been to sea,
I've fought 'gainst every odds—but I’ve
gained the victory!

That ship there is a Frenchman‚ and if we don’t

If she‘s not mine in half an hour, 1’11 flog each

For odds bobs, hammer and tongs‚ long as
I've been to sea,
I've fought 'gainst every odds—and I’ve
gained the victory! '
