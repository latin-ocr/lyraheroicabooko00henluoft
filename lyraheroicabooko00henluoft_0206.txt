176 HEMANS

Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
As born to rule the storm:

A creature of heroic blood,
A proud though child-like form.

'l'he flames rolled on—he would not go
Without his father's word;

That father, saint in death below,
His voice no longer heard.

He called aloud: ‘ Say, father! say
Ii yet my task is done! ’

He knew not that the chieitain lay
Unconscious of his son.

‘Speak, father! ¹ once again he cried,
‘lf I may yet be gone! ’

And but the booming shots replied,
And fast the flames rolled on.

Upon his brow he felt their breath,
And in his waving hair;

He looked from that lone post οἱ death
In still yet brave despair,

And shouted but once more aloud,
‘My father! must Ι stay? ’ ,

While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud.
The wreathing fires made way. ’

They wrapt the ship in splendour wild,
They caught the ssag on high,

And strcamcd above the gallant child
Like banners in the sky.
