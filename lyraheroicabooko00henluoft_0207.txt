HEMANS

There came a burst of thunder-sound—

The boy—O! where was he?
Ask of the winds that far around
With fragments strewed the sea:

With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,
That well had borne their part!

But the noblest thing which perished there
Was that young faithful heart.

THE PILGRIM FATHERS

THE breaking waves dashed high
On a stern and rock-bound coast,

And the woods against a stormy sky
Their giant branches tossed3

And the heavy night hung dark
The hills and' waters o'er,

When a band of exiles moored their bark
On the wild New England shore.

Not as the conqueror comes,
They, the true-hearted, came3

Not with the roll of the stirring drums,
And the trumpet that sings of fame3

Not as the flying come,
In silence and in seau—
