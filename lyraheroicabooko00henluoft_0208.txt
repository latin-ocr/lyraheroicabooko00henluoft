HEMANS

They shook the depths oi the desert gloom
With their hymns oi lofty cheer.

Amidst the storm they sang,
And the stars heard and the sea3

And the sounding aisles of the dim woods tang
To the anthem oi the free!

The ocean eagle soared
From his nest by the white wave’s foam3
And the rocking pines oi the forest roared—
This was their welcome home!

There were men with hoary hair
Amidst that pilgrim band,

Why had they come to wither there,
Away from their childhood’s land?

There was woman’s fearless eye,
Lit by her deep love's truth;

There was manhood's brow serenely high,
And the fiery heart of youth.

What sought they thus afar?
Bright jewels of the mine?

The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
They sought a faith's pure shrine!

Ay, call it holy ground,
T he soil where first they trod.

They have left unstained what there they found—
F reedom to worship God.
