TO THE ADVENTUROUS

MUCH have I travelled in the realms of gold,

⁷ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen3

Round many western islands have Ι been
Which bards in sealty to Apollo hold.

Oft οἱ one wide expanse had I been told

That deep—browed Homer ruled as his demesne:
Yet did Ι never breathe its pure serene

Till 1 heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
Then felt Ι like some watcher of the skies
When a new planet swims into his ken3

Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes

He stated at the Pacific—and all his men
Looked at each other with a wild surmise—

Silent, upon a peak in Darien. K
eats.

‘HORATIUS

THE TRYSTING

LARs PORSENA of Clusium
By the Nine Gods he swore

That the great house of Tarquin
Should suffer wrong no more.

By the Nine Gods he swore it,
And named a trysting day,

And bade his messengers ride forth

East and west and south and north
To summon his array.
