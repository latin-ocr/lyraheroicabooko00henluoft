MACAULAY

East and west and south and north
The messengers ride fast,
And tower and town and cottage
Have heard the trumpet’s blast.
Shame on the false Etruscan
Who lingers in his home,
When Porsena of Clusium
Is on the march for Rome.

Τὴε horsemen and the footmen
Are pouring in amain
From many a stately market-place,
From many a fruitful plain3
From many a lonely hamlet
Which, hid by beech and pine,
Like an eagle‘s nest hangs on the erest
Of purple Apennine3

From lordly Volaterrae,
Where scowls the far-famed hold
Piled by the hands of giants
For godlike kings of old;
From sea-girt Populonia
Whose sentinels descry
Sardinia's snowy mountain-tops
Fringing the southern sky ;

From the proud mart of Pisae,
Queen of the western waves,

Where ride Massilia’s triremes
Heavy with {air-haired slaves;
