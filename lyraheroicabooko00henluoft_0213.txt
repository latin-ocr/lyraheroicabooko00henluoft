MACAULAY

And with a mighty following
To join the muster carne

The Tusculan Mamilius,
Prince of the Latian name.

THE TROUBLE IN ROME

But by the yellow Tiber
Was tumult and affright:
From all the spacious champaign
To Rome men took their flight.
A mile around the city
The throng stopped up the ways 3
A fearful sight it was to see
Through two long nights and days.

For aged folk on crutches‚
And women great with child,
And mothers sobbing over babes
That clung to them and smiled,
And sick men borne in litters
High on the necks of slaves,
And troops of sun-burned husbandmen
With reaping-hooks and staves‚

And droves of mules and asses
Laden with skins of wine,
And endless flocks of goats and sheep,
And endless herds of kine,
And endless trains of waggons
That creaked beneath the weight
Of corn-saeks and of household goods,
Choked every roaring gate.
