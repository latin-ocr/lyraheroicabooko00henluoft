MACAU LAY

But the banner οἱ proud Clusium
Was highest of them all,

The terror oi the Umbrian,
The terror of the Gaul.

And plainly and more plainly
Now might the burghers know,
By port and vest, by horse and erest,
Each warlike Lucumo.
There Cilnius of Arretium
On his fleet roan was seen ;
And Astur of the fourfold shield‚
Girt with the brand none else may wield,
Tolumnius with the belt of gold,
And dark Verbenna from the hold

By reedy T hrasymene.

Fast by the royal standard
O'erlookiug all the war,

Lars Porsena of Clusium
Sate in his ivory car.

By the right wheel rode Mamilius,
Prince of the Latian name3

And by the leit false Sextus,
That wrought the deed of shame.

But when the face of Sextus
Was seen among the foes,
A yell that rent the firmament
From all the town arose.
