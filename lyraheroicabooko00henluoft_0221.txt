MACAU LAY

At Picus brave Horatius
Darted one fiery thrust,

And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms
Clashed in the bloody dust.

Then Ocnus of Falerii
Rushed on the Roman Three3
And Lausulus of Urgo,
The rover of the sea 3
And Aruns of Volsinium,
Who slew the great wild boar‚
The great wild boar that had his den
Amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,
And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,
Along Albinia's shore.

Herminius smote down Aruns:
Lartius laid Ocnus low:

Right to the heart of Lausulus
Horatius sent a blow.

‘Lie there,’ he cried, ‘fell pirate!
No more, aghast and pale,

From Ostia‘s walls the crowd shall mark

The track of thy destroying bark.

No more Campania's hinds shall ssy

To woods and caverns when they spy
Thy thrice-accursed sail.’

But now no sound of laughter
Was heard amongst the foes.

A wild and wrathful clamour
From all the vanguard rose.
