192 MACAULAY

Six spears‘ lengths from the entrance
Halted that deep army,

And ior a space no man came forth
'I‘o win the narrow way.

But hark! the cry is Astur:
And lo! the ranks divide;
And the great Lord of Luna
Comes with his stately stride.
Upon his ample shoulders
Clangs loud the fourfold shield,

And in his hand he shakes the brand
Which none but he can wield.

He smiled on those bold Romans
A smile serene and high;

He eyed the ssinching Tuscans,
And scorn was in his eye.

Quoth he, ‘The she-wolf’s litter
Stands savagely at bay:

But will ye dare to follow,
If Astur clears the way? ’

Then, whirling up his broadsword
With both hands to the height,
He rushed against Horatius,
And smote with all his might.
With shield and blacle Horatius
Right deftly turned the blow.

The blow, though turned, came yet too 115th
It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:
The 'fuscans raised a joyful cry ·

To see the red blood flow.
