MACAULAY

‘Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!
Now welcome to thy home!

Why dost thou stay, and turn away?
Here lies the road to Rome.‘

Thrice looked he at the city 3
Thrice looked he at the dead 5
And thrice came on in fury,
And thrice turned back in dread:
And, white with sear and hatred‚
Scowled at the narrow way
Where, wallowing in a pool of blood,
The bravest Tuscans lay.

But meanwhile axe and lever
Have mansully been plied3

And now the bridge hangs tottering
Above the boiling tide.

‘Come back, come back, Horatius! '
Loud cried the F athers all.

‘Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!
Back, ere the ruin fall! '

Back darted Spurius Lartius 3
Herminius darted back:

And, as they passed, beneath their feet
They felt the timbers crack.

But, when they turned their faces,
And on the farther shore

Saw brave Horatius stand alone,
They would have crossed once more.
