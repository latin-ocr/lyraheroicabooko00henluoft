MACAULAY

Nought spake he to Lars Porsena,
To Sextus nought spake he,-

But he saw on Palatinus
The white porch of his home;

And he spake to the noble river
That rolls by the towers of Rome.

‘O Tiber! father Tiber!
To whom the Romans pray,

A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,
Take thou in charge this day! '
So he spake, and speaking sheathed
The good sword by his side,
And with his harness on his back
Plunged headlong in the tide.

No sound of joy or sorrow
Was heard from either bank 3

But friends and foes in dumb surprise,

With parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank 3

And when above the surges
They saw his erest appear,

All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,

And even the ranks of Tuscany
Could scarce forbear to cheer.

But fiercely ran the current,
Swollen high by months of rain:

And fast his blood was flowing;
And he was sore in pain,
