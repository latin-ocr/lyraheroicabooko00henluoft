MACAULAY

And heavy with his armour,
And spent with changing blows:
And ost they thought him sinking,
But still again he rose.

Never, I ween, did swimmer,
In such an evil case,

Struggle through such a raging flood
Safe to the landing-place:

But his limbs were borne up bravely
By the brave beart within,

And our good father Tiber
Bare bravely up his chin.

‘Curse on him! ’ quoth false Sextus;
‘Will not the villain drown?
But for this stay ere close of day
We should have sacked the town! '
‘Heaven help him! ' quoth Lars Porsena,
‘And bring him saie to shore3
For such a gallam {eat of arms
Was never seen before!

And now he feels the bottorn ;
Now on dry earth he stands3

Now round him throng the Fathers
To press his gory hands;

And now with shouts and clapping,
And noise of weeping loud,

He enters through the River-Gate‚
Borne by the joyous crowd.
