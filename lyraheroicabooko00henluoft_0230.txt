200 MACAU LAY

When round the lonely cottage
Roars loud the tempest's din,

And the good logs οἱ Algidus
Roar louder yet within 3

When the oldest cask is opened,
And the largest lamp is lit;

When the chestnuts glow in the embers,
And the kid turns on the spit5

When young and old in circle
Around the firebrands close,-

When the girls are weaving baskets‚
And the lads are shaping bows;

When the goodman mends his armour
And trims his helmet‘s plume3
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily
Goes flashing through the loom 5
With weeping and with laughter
Still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge
In the brave days of old.
