MACAULAY 201

When that great fleet invincible against her bore
in vain

The richest spoils of Mexico‚ the stoutest hearts of
Spain.

It was about the lovely close os a warm summer day,

There came a gallant merchant—ship full sail to
Plymouth Bay3

Her crew hath seen Castile’s black fieet, beyond
Aurigny's isle,

At earliest twilight‚ on the waves lie heaving many
a mile.

At sunrise she escaped their van, by God’s especial
grace 3

And the tall Pinta, till the noon, had held her close
in chase.

Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along
the wall ;

The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe’s
lofty hall;

Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the
coast, ’

And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland
many a post.

With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff
comes;

Behind him march the halberdiers3 before him
sound the drums3

His yeomen round the market cross make clear an
ample space 3

For there behoves him to set up the standard of
Her Grace.
