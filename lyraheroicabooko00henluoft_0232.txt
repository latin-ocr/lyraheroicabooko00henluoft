And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance

As 8¹th ¹³¹3ch the labourinz wind the royal blazon

LOOkShngthe Lion of the sea lif ts up his ancient crom,

And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies

So sllaclkeld he when he turned to ssight, on that
famed Picard field,

Bohemia's plume, and Genoa’s bow, and Caesar’s
engle shield.

So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned

And {321}th and torn beneath his claws the princely
hunters lay.

Ho! strike the flagstaff deep, Sir Knight: ho! scatter
flowers, fair maids:

Ho! gunners, fire a loud salute: ho! gallants, draw
your blades:

Thou sun, shine on her joyously: ye breezes, wast Ἴ

her wide;
Our glorious summan EADEM, the banner of our pride.

The freshening breeze of eve uniurled that banner’s
massy fold5
The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty
scroll oi gold;
Night sank upon the dusky beach and on the
purple sea,
Such night in England ne'er had been, nor e'er
again shall be.
