MACAU LAY 203

From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to
Milford Bay,

That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day ;

For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-
flame spread,

High on St. Michael’s Mount it shone: it shone on
Beachy Head.

Far on the deep the Spaniard saw, along each
southern shire,

Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling
points of fire,

The fisher left his skiff to roek on Tamar’s glittering
waves:

The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip’s
sunless caves!

O'er Longleat‘s towers, o’er Cranbourne‘s oaks, the
fiery herald flew:

He roused the shepherds of Stonehenge‚ the rangers
of Beaulieu.

Right sharp and quiek the bells all night tang out
from Bristol town,

And ere the day three hundred horse had met on
Clifton down3

The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into
the night,

And saw o'erhanging Richmond Hill the streak of
blood-red light:

Then bugle⁷s note and cannon’s roar the death-like
silence broke,

And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city
woke.
