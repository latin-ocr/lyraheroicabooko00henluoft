LONGFELLOW

We’ll cross the Tamar, land to land,
'rhe Severn is no stay,

With “one and all‚'’ and hand in hand,
And who shall bid us nay?

And when we corne to London Wall,
A pleasant sight to view,

Come forth! corne forth! ye cowards all,
Here's men as good as you.

Trelawny he’s in keep and hold,
Trelawny he may die;

But here's twenty thousand Cornish bold
W ill know the reason why! '

Hawker.

THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP
Tm: MODEL

‘BULD me straight, O worthy Master!
Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel,
That shall laugh at all disaster,
And with wave and whirlwind wrestle! '

The merchant's word

Delighted the Master heard;

For his heart was in his work, and the heart
Giveth grace unto every Art. ·

Α quiet smile played round his lips,

As the eddies and dimples of the tide

Play round the bows of ships,

That steadily at anchor ride.
