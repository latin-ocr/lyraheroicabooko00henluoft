And above them all, and strangest of all,
Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall,
Whose picture was hanging on the wall,
With bows and stem raised high in air,
And baleonies hanging here and there,
And signal lanterns and flags afloat,

And eight round towers‚ like those that frown
From some old casde, looking down
Upon the drawbridge and the moat.

And he said with a smile, ‘Our ship, I wis,

Built for freight, and yet for speed,
A beautiful and gallant craft,-
