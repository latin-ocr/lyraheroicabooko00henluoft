LONGFELLOW

Broad in the beam, that the stress οἱ the blast,
Pressing down upon sail and mast,

Might not the sharp bows overwhelm;

Broad in the beam, but sloping ast

With graceful curve and slow degrees,

That she might be docile to the helm,

And that the currents of parted seas,

Closing behind, with mighty force,

Might aid and not impede her course.

THE BUILDERS

In the ship-yard stood the Master,
With the model os the vessel,
Tha0t should laugh at all disaster,
And with wave and whirlwind wrestle Ι

Covering many a rood of ground,

Lay the timber piled around;

Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak,
And scattered here and there, with these,
The knarred and crooked cedar knees;
Brought {rom regions far away,

From Pascagoula’s sunny bay,

And the banks of the roaring Roanoke!
Ah! what a wondrous thing it is

To note how many wheels of toil

One thought, one word, can set in motion!
There's not a ship that sails the ocean,
But every climate, every soil,

Must bring its tribute, great or small,
And help to build the wooden wall!
