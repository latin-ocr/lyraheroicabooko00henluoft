LONGFELLOW 211

The sun was rising o’ er the sea,

And long the level shadows lay,

As if they, too, the beams would be
Of some great, airy argosy,

F ramed and launehed in a single day.
That silent architect‚ the sun,

Had hewn and laid them every one,
Ere the work of man was yet begun.
Beside the Master‚ when he spoke,

A youth, against an anchor leaning,
Listened to catch his slightest meaning.
Only the long waves, as they broke
In ripples on the pebbly beach,
Interrupted the old man’s speech.

Beautiful they were, in sooth,

The old man and the fiery youth!

The old man, in whose busy brain

Many a shrp that sailed the main

Was modelled o'er and o' er again 3—

The fiery youth, who was to be

The heir of his dexterity‚

The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand,
When he had built and launched from land
What the elder head had planned.

‘Thus‚' said he, ‘will we build this ship!
Lay square the blocks upon the slip,
And follow well this plan of mine.
Choose the timbers with greatest eare3
Of all that is unsound beware ς
