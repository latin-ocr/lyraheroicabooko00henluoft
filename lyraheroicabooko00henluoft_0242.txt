LONGFELLOW

For only what is sound and strong
To this vessel shall belong.

Cedat of Maine and Georgia pine
Here together shall combine.

A goodly imme, and a goodly fame,
And the Uxiox be her name!

For the day that gives her to the sea
Shall give my daughter unto thee! ’

The Master's word

Enraptured the young man heard3

And as he turned his face aside,

With a look oi joy and a thrill of pride,
standing before

Her father's door,

He saw the form of his promised bride.
The sun shone on her golden hair,

And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,
With the breath of morn and the solt sea air.
Like a beauteous barge was she,

Still at rest on the sandy beach,

Just beyond the billow's reach3

But he

Was the resssess, seething, stormy seal

Ah ἔ how skilful grows the hand
That obeyeth Love's command!

It is the heart, and not the brain,
That to the highest doth attain,
And he who followeth Love's behest
Far exceedeth all the rest!
