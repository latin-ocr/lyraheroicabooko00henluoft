LONGFELLOW 213

Thus with the rising of the sun

Was the noble task begun,

And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds
Were heard the intermingled sounds
Of axes and of mallets, plied

With vigourous arms on every side,·
Plied so deftly and so well,

That ere the shadows of evening fell,
The keel of oak for a noble ship,
Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong,
Was lying ready, and stretched along
The blocks, well placed upon the slip.
Happy, thrice happy, every one

Who sees his labour well begun,

And not perplexed and mustiplied,

By idly waiting for time and tide!

And when the hot, long day was o’er,
The young man at the Master’s door

Sat with the maiden calm and still.

And within the porch‚ a little more
Removed beyond the evening chill,

The father sat, and told thern tales

Of wrecks in the great September gales,
Of pirates upon the Spanish Main,

And ships that never carne back agaim
The chance and change of a sailor's life,
Want and plenty, rest and strife,

His roving fancy, like the wind,

That nothing can stay and nothing can bind;
And the magic charm of foreign lands,
With shadows of palms and shining sands,
