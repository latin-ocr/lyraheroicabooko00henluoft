216 LONGFELLOW

On many a dreary and misty night

'Twill be seen by the rays of the signal light,
Speeding along through the rain and the dark‚
Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,

The pilot of some phantom bark,

Guiding the vessel in its ssight

By a path none other knows aright.

Behold, at last,

Each tall and tapering mast

Is swung into its place5

Shrouds and stays

Holding it firm and fast!

Long ago,

In the deer-haunted forests οἱ Maine,
When upon mountain and plain

Lay the snow,

They fell—those lordly pines Ξ

Those grand, maiestic pines!

'M id shouts and cheers

The jaded steers,

Panting beneath the goad, Ι
Dragged down the weary, winding road
Those captive kings so straight and tall,
To be shorn of their streaming hair
And, naked and bare,

To feel the stress and the strain

Of the wind and the reeling main,
Whose roar

Wouldtremind them for evermore

Of their native {orest they should not see again.
