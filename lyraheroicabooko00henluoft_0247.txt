LONGFELLOW ⁷ 217

And everywhere

The slender, graceful spars

Poise alost in the air,

And at the mast head,

White, blue, and red,

A flag unrolls the stripes and stars.

Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,

In foreign harbours shall behold

That' flag unrolled,

'Twill be as a friendly hand

Stretched out from his native land,

Filling his heart with memories sweet and end-
less.

THE TWO BRIDALS

All is finished! and at length

Has come the bridal day

Of beauty and of strength.

To-day the vessel ,shall be launched!
With fieecy clouds the sky is blanched,
And o’er the bay,

Slowly, in all his splendours dight,
The great sun rises to behold the sight.
The ocean old,

Centuries old,

Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled‚
Paces restless to and fro

Up and down the sands of gold.

His beating heart is not at rest,

And far and wide,
