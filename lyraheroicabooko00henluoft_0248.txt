LONGFELLOW

With ceaseless flow,
His beard of snow
Heaves with the heaving oi his breast.

He waits impatient ior his bride.

There she stands,

With her foot upon the sands,

Decked with flags and streamers gay

In honour oi her marriage day,

Her snow-white signals fluttering‚ blending‚
Round her like a veil descending,

Ready to be

The bride of the grey, old sea.

On the deck another bride

Is standing by her lover's side.
Shadows from the fiags and shrouds‚
Like the shadows cast by clouds,
Broken by many a sunny fleck,

F all around them on the deck.

The prayer is said,

The service read,

The joyous bridegroom bows his head,
And in tears the good old Master
Shakes the brown hand oi his son,
Kisses his daughter’s glowing cheek
In silence, ior he cannot speak,

And ever faster

Down his own 'the tears begin to run.
The worthy pastor—

The Shepherd of that wandering flock,
