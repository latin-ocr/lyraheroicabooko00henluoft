LONGFELLOW

That has the ocean for its wold‚

T hat has the vessel for its sold,
Leaping ever from rock to rock—
Spake, with accents mild and clear,
Words of warning‚ words of cheer,
But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.
He knew the chart,

Of the sailor's beart,

All its pleasures and its griefs,

All its shallows and rocky reefs,

All those secret currents that flow
With such resistless undert0w‚

And lift and drift with terrible force,

The will from its moorings and its course.

Therefore he spake, and thus said he:

‘Like unto ships far off at sea,
Outward or homeward bound, are we.
Before, behind, and all around,

Floats and swings the horizon's bound,
Seems at its distant rim to rise

And climb the crystal wall of the skies,
And then again to turn and sink,

As if we could slide from its outer brink.
Ah ! it is not the sea,

It is not the sea that sinks and shelves,
But ourselves

That rock and rise

With endless and uneasy mofion,

Now touching the very skies‚

Now sinking into the depths of ocean.
