Ah! if our souls but poise and swing

Like the compass in its brazen ring,

Ever level, and ever true

To the toil and the task we have to do,

We shall sail secmely, and safely reach

The Fortunate lsles, on whose shining beach
The sights we see, and the sounds we hear,
Will be those of joy and not oi sear! ’

Then the Master,

With a gesture of command,

Waved his hand;

And at the word,

Loud and sudden there was heard,

All around them and below,

The sound of hammers, blow on blow,
Knocking away the shores and spurs,

And see! she stirs!
She starts—she moves—she seems to feel

The thrill of life along her keel,

And, spuming with her soot the ground,
With one exulting, joyous bound,

She leaps into the ocean‘s arms ἔ

And lo ! from the assembled crowd
There rose a shout‚ prolonged and loud,
That to the ocean seemed to say,—

‘ Take her, Ο bridegroom, old and grey,
Take her to thy protecting arms,

With all her youth· and all her charms 1’

How beautiful she is ! How sair
She lies within those ιιι-ωε, that press
