LONGFELLOW

Her form with many a soft caress

Of tenderness and watehful care ἒ

Sail forth into the sea, O ship !

Through wind and wave, right onward steer 1
The moistened eye, the trembling lip,

Are not the signs of doubt or sear.

Sail forth into the sea of life,

O gentle, loving, trusting wife,
And safe from all adversity

Upon the bosom of that sea

Thy comings and thy goings be !
For gentleness and love and trust
Prevail o'er angry wave and gust 3
And in the wreck of noble lives
Something immortal still survives l

Thou, too, sail on, O ship of State !

Sail on, O Union, strong and great Ξ
Humanity with all its fears,

With all the hopes of future years,

Is hanging breathless on thy fate !

We know what Master laid thy keel,
What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel‚
Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,
What anvils rang, what hammers beat,

In what a forge and what a heat

Were shaped the anchors of thy hope !
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
'Tis of the wave and not the rock 3

'Tis but the flapping of the sail,
