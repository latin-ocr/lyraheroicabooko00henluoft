LONGFELLOW

And not a rent made by the gale Ι

In spite of rock and tempest’s roar,

In spite of salse lights on the shore,

Sail on, nor sear to breast the sea!

Our hearts, our hopes, are au with thee,

Our beans, our hopes, our prayers‚ our team,
Oux· saith triumphant o’er our sears,

Are all with thee,--are all with thee !
