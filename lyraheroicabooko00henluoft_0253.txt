THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE

OTHERE, the old sea-captain,
- Who dwelt in Helgoland‚
To King Alfred, the Lover of Truth,
Brought a snow-white walrus-tooth,
Which he held in his brown right hand.

His figure was tall and stately,
Like a boy's his eye appeared5

His hair was yellow as hay,

But threads of a silvery grey
Gleamed in his tawny heard.

Hearty and hale was Othere‚

His cheek had the colour of oak3
With a kind of laugh in his speech,
Like the sea-tide on a hezich,

As unto the king he spoke.

And Alfred, King of the Saxons,
Had a book upon his knees,
And wrote down the wondrous tale
Of him who was first to sail
Into the Aretic seas.

‘So far I live to the northward,
No man lives north of me;
To the east are wild mountain-chains,
And beyond them meres and plains3
To the westward all is sea.
