LONGFELLOW

So far I live to the northward,

From the harbour ol skeringes-hale,
11 you only sailed by day
With a fair wind all the way,

More than a mouth would you sail.

Ι own six hundred reindeer,
With sheep and swine beside ;

Ι have tribute from the Finns,

W halebone and reindeer-skins‚
And ropes of walrus-hide.

Ι ploughed the land with homes,
But my beart was ill at ease,
For the old seafaring men
Came to me now and then,
With their sagas of the seas;-

Of Iceland and of Greenland,
And the stormy Hebrides,
And the undiscovered deep 3—

I could not eat nor sleep
For thinking οἱ those seas.

To the northward stretched the desert,
How far 1 fain would know3

So at last I sallied forth,

And three days sailed due north,
As far as the whale-ships go.

To the west of me was the ocean,
'l'o the right the desolate shore,
But I did not slacken sail
For the walrus or the whale,
'l'ill after three days more.
