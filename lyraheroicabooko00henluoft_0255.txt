LONGFELLOW

The days grew longer and longer,
Till they became as one,
And southward through the haze
I saw the sullen blaze
Of the red midnight sun.

And then uprose before me,
Upon the water's edge,

The huge and haggard shape

Of that unknown North Cape,
Whose form is like a wedge.

The sea was rough and stormy,

The tempest howled and wailed,

And the sea-sog, like a ghost‚
Haunted that dreary coast,
But onward still I sailed.

Four days Ι steered to eastward,
F our days without a night:

Round in a fiery ring

Went the great sun, O King,
With red and lurid light.'

Here AMred, King of the Saxons,
Ceased writing for a while3

And raised his eyes from his book,

With a strange and puzzled look,
And an incredulous smile-

But Othere, the old sea-captain,
He neither paused nor stirred‚

Till the King listened, and then

Once more took up his pen,
And wrote down every word.
