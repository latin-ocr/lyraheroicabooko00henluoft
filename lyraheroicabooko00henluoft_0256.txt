‘226

LONGFELLOW

‘And now the land,' said Othere,
‘Bent southward suddenly,
And Ι followed the curving shore,
And ever southward bore
Into a nameless sea.

And there we hunted the walms,
The narwhale, and the seal3

Ha! 'twas a noble game!

And like the lightning’s flame
Flew our harpoons oi steel.

There were six oi us all together,
Norsemen of Helgoland3

In two days and no more

We killed of them threescore,

And dragged them to the strand.’

Here Alfred‚ the Truth-Teller,
Suddenly closed his book,

And lifted his blue eyes,

With doubt and strange surmise
Depicted in their look.

And Othere, the old sea-captain,
Stared at him wild and weird,

Then smiled till his shining teeth

Gleamed white from underneath
His tawny, quivering heard.

And to the King of the Saxeus,
In witness of the truth‚

Raising his noble head,

He stretched his brown hand, and said,
‘Behold this walrus·tooth! ⁹
