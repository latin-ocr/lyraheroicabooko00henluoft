LONGFELLOW 227

XC1
THE CUMBERLAND

AT anchor in Hampton Roads we lay,
On board of the Cumberland, sloop of war3
And at times from the fortress across the bay
The alarum of drums swept past,
Or a bugle blast
From the camp on the shore.

Then far away to the south uprose
A little feather of snow-white smoke,
And we knew that the iron ship of our foes
Was steadily steering its course
To try the force
Of our ribs of oak.

Down upon us heavily runs,
Silent and sullen‚ the floating fort;
Then comes a puff of smoke from her guns,
And leaps the terrible death,
With fie'ry breath,

From each open port.

We are not idle, but send her straight
Defiance back in a full broadside!
As hail rebounds from a roof of slate,
Rebounds our heavier hail
From each iron scale
Of the monster’s hide.

‘Strike your flag! ’ the rebel eries,
In his arrogant old plantation strain.
‘Never!’ our gallant Morris replies3
