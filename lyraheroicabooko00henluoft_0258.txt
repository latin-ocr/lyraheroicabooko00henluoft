228 LONGFELLOW

‘It is better to sink than to yield!·
And the whole air pealed
With the cheers ot our men.

Then, like a krakcn hugo and black,
She crushed our ribs in her iron grasp!
Down went the Cumberland all a wreck,
With a sudden shudder ot death,
And the cannon‘s breath
For her dying gasp.

Next morn, as the sun rose over the bay,
Still floated our flag at the mainmast head.
Lord‚ how beautiful was thy day!
Every wast of the air
Was a whisper of prayer,
Or a dirge for the dead.

Ho! brave hearts that went down in the seas,
Ye are at peace in the troubled stream!
Ho! brat-e land! with hearts like these,
Thy flag that is rent in twain
Shall be one again,
And without a seam!

A DUTCH PICTURE

SmoN Daemz has come home again,

From cruising about with his buccaneers;
He has singed the beard οἱ the King οἱ Spain,
And carried away the Dean of Jaen

And sold him in Algiers.
