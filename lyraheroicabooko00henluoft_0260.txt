230 WHITTIER

And they talk of their ventures lost or που,
And their talk is ever and ever the same,
While they drink the red wine oi Tarragon,
From the cellars ol some Spanish Don
Or convent set on flame.

Restless at times, with heavy strides
He paces his parlour to and iro;

He is like a ship that at anchor rides,

And swings with the rising and falling tides,
And tugs at her anchor-tOW.

Voices mysterious far and near,

Sound oi the wind and sound ol the sea,
Are calling and whispering in his ear,
‘Simon Danz! Why stayest thou here?

Come forth and follow me! ‘

So he thinks he shall take to the sea again

For one more cruise with his buccaneers,
To singe the beard oi the King of Spain.
And capture another Dean οἱ Jaen

And sell him in Algiers.
Longfillow.

Clear in the cool September mom,

The clustered spires oi Frederick stand
Green-walled by the hills oi Maryland.
