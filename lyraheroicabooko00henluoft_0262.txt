232 ⁷ TENNYSON

Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf5

She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will.

‘Shoot‚ if you must, this old grey head,
But spate your country’s flag,’ she mid.

A shade of sadness‚ a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came3

The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman’s deed and word:

‘Who touches a hair of yon grey head
Dies like a dog! March on! ' he said.

All day long through F rederick street
Sounded the tread of marching feet:

All day long that free flag tost
Over the heads os the rebel host.

Ever its torn folds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that loved it well ς

And through the hill-gaps sunset light

Shone over it with a warm good-night.
