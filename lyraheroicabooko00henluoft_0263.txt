TEN N YSON 233

‘Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-
three 1’

Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: ‘’Fore God Ι
am no coward 3

But Ι cannot meet them here, sor my ships are out
of gear,

And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but
follow quick. v

We are six ships of the line3 ean we fight with fifty-
three?'

Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: ‘ 1 know you are
no coward 3

You fly them for a moment to fight with them
agam.

But I‘ve ninety men and more that are lying sick
ashore.

I should count myself the coward if I left them, my
Lord Howard,

To· these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of

Spain!

So Lord Howard passed away with five ships of war

Till ἳὶέῖῐῗιίἵέεᾱ like a cloud in the silent summer
heaven ;

But Sir Richard bore in hand all the sick men from
the land

Very carefully and slow,

Men of Bideford in Devon,

And we laid them on the ballast down below 3
For we brought them all aboard,
