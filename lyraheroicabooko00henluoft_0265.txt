TEN N YSON 235

Thousands of their soldiers looked down from their
decks and laughed,

Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad
little craft

Running on and on, till delayed

By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen
hundred tons,

And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning
tiers of guns,

Took the breath from our sails, and we stayed.

And while now the great San Philip hung above us
like a cloud

Whence the thunderbolt will fall

Long and lond,

Four galleons drew away

From the Spanish fleet that day,

And two upon the larboard and two upon the star-
board lay,

And the battle thunder broke irorn them all.

But anon the great San Philip, she bethought her-
self and went,

Having that within her womb that had left her ill
content; >

And the rest they came aboard uS, and they 'fought
us hand to hand,

For a dozen times they came with their pikes and
musqueteers,

And a dozen times we shook ’em off as a dog that
shakes his ears

When he leaps from the water to the land.
