TEN N YSON 2:37

So they watched what the end would be.

And we had not fought them in vain,

But in perilous plight were we,

Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,

And half of the rest of us maimed for life

In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate
strife3

And the sick men down in the hold were most of
them stark and cold,

And the pikes were all broken or bem, and the
powder was all of it spent3

And the masts and the rigging were lying over the
side3

But Sir Riehard cried in his English pride:
‘We have fought such a fight for a day and a night
As may never be fought again!

· We have one great glory, my men!

And a day less or more

At sea or ashore,

We die—does it mat'ter when?

Sink me the ship, Master Gunner-sink her, split
her in twain!

Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of
Spain?

And the gunner said, ‘Ay‚ ay,' but the seamen made
reply:

‘We have children, we have wives,

And the Lord hath spared our lives.

We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to
let us go 3
