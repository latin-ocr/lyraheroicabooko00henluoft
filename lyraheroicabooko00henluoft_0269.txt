TENNYSON 239

When a wind froin the lands they had ruined awoke
from sleep,

And the water began to heave and the weather to
moan,

And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,

And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earth-
quake grew,

Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their
masts and their flags,

And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-
shattered navy oi Spain,

And the little Revenge herself went down by the
island crags

To be lost evermore in the main.

THE HEAVY BRIGADE

THE charge of the gallant three hundred, the Heavy
Brigade!

Down the hill, down the hill, thousands of Russians,

Thousands of horsemen, drew to the valley—and
stayed3

For Scarlett and Scarlett’s three hundred were riding
by

When the points of the Russian lances arose in the
sky;

And he called, ‘Left wheel into line! ’ and they
wheeled and obeyed.

Then he looked at the host that had halted he knew

not why,
