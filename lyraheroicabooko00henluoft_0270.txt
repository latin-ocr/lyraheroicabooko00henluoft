And he turned half round, and he bad his trumpeter '

To ῑὶῗὲυςῖιῖτςε, and he rode on abead, as he waved '

To ῑῑξέδςξῗῖεῗιξῑ three hundred whose glory will never
‘Follglvess and up the hill, up the hill, up the hill,
Followed the Heavy Brigade.

The trumpet, the gallop‚ the charge, and the might
oi the fight!

Thousands of horsemen had gathered there on the ·

Withhilffitng pushed out to the lest and a wing to

And ῖνῖιῖὶῗοῃξῑῗιῖᾖ escape if they close? but he dashed
up alone

Through the great grey slope of rnen,

Swayed his sabre, and held his own

Like an Englishman there and then;

All in a moment followed with force

Three that were next in their fiery course,

Wedged themselves in between horse and horse, .

Fought for their lives in the narrow gap they had 2
made-

Four amid thousands! and up the hill, up the hill,

Gallopt the gallant three hundred, the Heavy ἱ
Brigade.

Fell like a cannon-shot,
Burst like a thunderbolt,
Crashed like a hurricane,
