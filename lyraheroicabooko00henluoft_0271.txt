TENNYSON 211

Broke through the mass from belom

Drove through the midst of the foe,

Plunged up and down, to and fro,

Rode flashing blow upon blow,

Brave Inniskillens and Greys

Whirling their sabres in circles of light!

And some of us, all in amaze,

Who were held for a while from the sight,

And were only standing at gaze,

When the dark-muffled Russian crowd

Folded its wings from the left and the right,

And rolled them around like a cloud,—

O mad for the charge and the battle were we,

When our own good redcoats sank from sight,

Like drops of blood in a dark grey sea,

And we turned to each other, whispering‚ all dismayed,

‘Lost are the gallant three hundred of Scarlett’s
Brigade! ’

‘Lost one and all’ were the words
Muttered in our dismay;

But they rode like Victors and Lords
Through the forest of lances and swords
In the heart of the Russian hordes,
They rode, or they stood at bay—
Struck with the sword-hand and slew,
Down with the bridle-hand drew

The foe from the saddle and threw
Underfoot there in the fray—

Ranged like a storrn or stood like a rock
In the wave of a stormy day,-
