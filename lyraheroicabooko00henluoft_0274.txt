THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR

Emvm men of England

A breastwork charged in vain 3
Eleven men of England

Lie stripped, and gashed, and slain.
Slain; but of foes that guarded

Their rock-built fortress well,

Some twenty had been mastered,
When the last soldier fell.

Whilst Napier piloted his wondrous way
Across the saud-waves of the desert sea,
Then flashed at once, on each fieree elan, dismay,
Lord of their wild Truckee.
These missed the glen to which their steps were bent,
Mistook a mandate, from afar half heard,
And, in that glorious error, calmly went
To death without a word.

The robber-chief mused deeply
Above those daring dead;
‘Bring here,' at length he shouted,
‘Bring quick, the battle thread.
Let Eblis blast for ever
Their souls, if Allah will:
But ψη must keep unbroken
The old rules οἱ the Hill.

Before the Ghiznee tiger
Leapt forth to burn and slay;
