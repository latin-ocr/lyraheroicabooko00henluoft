DOY LE ‘247

But were those heroes living
And strong for battle still,
Would Mehrad Khan or Rustum
Have climbed, like these, the hill? '

And they replied, ‘T hough Mehrab Khan was brave,
As chief, he chose himself what risks to run5
Prince Rustum lied, his forfeit life to save,
Which these had never done.’

‘Enoughl ' he shouted fiercely3
Doomed though they be to hell,

Bind fast the crinison trophy
Round 130TH wrists—bind it well.

Who knows but that great Allah
May grudge such matchless men,

With none so decked in heaven,
To the fiends’ flaming den?’

Then all those gallant robbers
Shouted a 'stern ‘Amenl ’

They raised the slaughtered sergeant,
They raised his mangled ten.

And when we found their bodies
Left bleaching in the wind,

Around sso‘ffl wrists in glory
That crimson thread was twined.

Then Napier's knightly heart, touched to the core,
Rung, like an echo, to that knightly deed,
He bade its mcmory live for evermore,
That those who run may read.
