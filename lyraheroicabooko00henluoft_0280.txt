250 BROWN IN G

‘Here’s the English at our hee1s; would you have
them take in tow
All that‘s left us of the nect, linked together stem
and bow,
For a prize to Plymouth Sound?
Better run the ships aground! ’
(Ended Damfreville his speech).
Not a minute more to wait!
‘Let the captains all and each

Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on
the beach!

F rance must undergo her fate.

Give the word! ’ But no such word
Was ever spoke or heard;
For up stood, ior out stepped, for in struck amid
all these
—A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate—first,
second, third?
No such man of mark, and meet
With his betters to compete!
But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville
for the fleet‚
A poor coasting-pilot he, Herve Riel the Croisickese.

And, ‘What mockery or mallee have we here?'
eries Herve Riel:
‘Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards,
fools, or rogues?
Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the
soundings‚ tell
On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
