BROWNING 251

'Twixt the offing here and Greve where the river
disembogues?
Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the
lying’s for?
Morn and eve, night and day,
Have Ι piloted your bay,
Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of
Solidor.

Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were
worse than fifty Hogues!
Sirs, they know I §peak the truth! Sirs, be-
lieve me there’s a way!
Only let me lead the line,
Have the biggest ship to steen
Get this Formidable clear,
Make the others follow mine,
And Ι lead them, most and least, by a passage I
know well,
Right to Solidor past Crem,
And there lay thern safe and sound;
And if one ship misbehave,
—Keel so much as grate the ground,
Why, I’ve nothing but my life‚—here's my headL’
eries Herve': Riel.

Not a minute more to wait.
‘Steer us in, then, small ancl great!
Take the belm, lead the line, save the squadront’
cried his chief.
‘captains, give the sailor place!
He is Admiral, in brief.
