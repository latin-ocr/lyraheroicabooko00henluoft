252 BROWN 1 NG

Stin the north-wind, by God's grace!
See the noble feilow’s face,
As the big ship with a bound,
Clears the entry like a hound,
Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide
seas profound!
See, saie thro' shoal and rock,
How they follow in a nocie,
Not a ship that misbehaves‚ not a keei that grates
the ground,
Not a spar that comes to grief!
The perii, see, is past,
Α11 are harboured to the last,
And just as Herve Riel hollas ‘Anchor!’—sure as
sate
Up the English come, too late!

So, the storm subsides to caim:
They see the green trees wave
On the o'erlooking Greve.
Hearts that bied are stanched with balm.
‘Just our rapture to enhance‚
Let the English take the bay,
Gnash their teeth and glare askance,
As they cannonade away!
’Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the
Rance! ’
How hope succeeds despair on each Captain’s coun-
tenance!
Out burst all with one accord,
‘This is Paradise for Hell!
