BROWNING 2513

Let France, let France‘s King
Thank the man that did the thing! ’
What a shout, and all one word,
‘Herve Riel! '
As he stepped in front once more,
Not a symptom of surprise
In the frank blue Breton eyes,
Just the same man as before.

Δ Then said Damsteville, ‘My friend,

I must speak out at the end,
Though 1 find the speaking hard.

Praise is deeper than the lips:

You have saved the King his ships,
You must name your own reward.

’Faith our sun was near eclipse!

Demand whate'er you will,

France remains your debtor still.

Ask to heart’s content and have! or my name’s not

Damsreville. '

Then a bearn of fun outbroke

’ On the bearded mouth that spoke,

As the honest heart laughed through
Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
‘Since I needs must say my say,
Since on board the duty’s done,
And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point‚ what is it
but a run?—
Since ’tis ask and have, I may—
Since the others go ashore—
Come! A good whole holiday!
