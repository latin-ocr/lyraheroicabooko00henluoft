Leave to go and see my wife, whom 1 call the
Belle Aurore! ¹
That he asked and that hc got,—n0thing more.

Narne and deed alike arc lost:
Not a pillar nor a post
In his Croisic keeps alive the {eat as it bele113
Not a head in white and black
On a single fishing smack,
In memory οἱ the man but for whom had gone to
wrack
All that F rance saved from the fight whence
England bore the bell.
Go to Paris: rank on rank
Search the heroes flung pell-mell
On the Louvre‚ face and flank!
You shall look long enough ere you come to
Hervt‘: Riel.
So, sor better and for worse,
Herve Riel, accept my verse!
In my verse, Herve Riel, do thou once more
Save the squadron, honour F sance, love thy wife, the

Belle Aurore!
Browning.

THE DYING FIREMAN

1 ΑΜ the mashed fireman with breast-bone broken,

Tumbling walls buricd me in their debris,

Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling
shouts οἱ my comrades,
