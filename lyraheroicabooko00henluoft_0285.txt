WHITMAN 255

Ι heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,

They have cleared the beams away, they tenderly
list me forth.

Ι lie in the night air in my red shirt‚ the pervading
hush is for my sake,

Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy,

white and beautiful are the faces around me, the
heads are bared of their fite-eam,

The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.

A SEA—FIGHT

WoULD you hear of an old-time sea-fight?

Would you leam who won by the light of the moon
and stars?

List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the
sailor told it to me.

‘Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you (said he),

His was the surly English pluck, and there is no
tougher or truer, and never vulfi, and never will be3

Along the lowered eve he came horribly raking us.

We closed with him, the yards entangled‚ the
cannon touched,
My captain lashed fast with his own hands.

We had received some eighteen-pound shots under
the water,

On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst
at the first fire, killing all around and blowing
up overhead.
