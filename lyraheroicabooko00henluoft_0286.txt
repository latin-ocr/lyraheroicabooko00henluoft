256 WHITMAN

F ighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,

Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our
leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,

The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in
the after-hold to give them a chance for them-
selves.

The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt
by the sentinels,

They see so many strange faces they do not know
whom to trust.

Our {rigate takes fire,
The other asks if we demand quarter?
If our colours are struck and the fighting done?

Now Ι laugh content, for I hear the voice of my
little captain,

“ We have not struck‚'’ he composedly eries, “ we have
just begun our part of the fighting.’'

Only three guns are in use,
One is directed by the captain himself against the
enemy’s main-mast,
Two well served with grape ancl canister silence his
· musketry and clear his decks.

The tops alone second the fire of this little battery,
especially the main-top,
They hold out bravely during the whole os the action.

Not a moment’s cease,
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the flre eats to-
ward the powder-magazine.
