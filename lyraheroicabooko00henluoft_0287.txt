WH ITMAN 257

One of the pumps had been shot away, it is generally
thought we are sinking.

Serene stands the little captain,

He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,

His eyes give more light to us than our battle-
lanterns.

Toward twelve‚ there in the beams of the moon, they
surrender to us.’ ’

BEAT! BEAT! DRUMS!

BEAT! beat! drumsl—blow! bugles! blow!

Through the windows—through doors—burst like a
ruthless force,

Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,

Into the school where the scholar is studying3

Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must
he have now with his bride,

Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his
field or gathering his grain,

So fierce you whirr and pound, you drums—so shrill,
you bugles, blow.

, Beat! beat! drumsl—blow! buglesl blow!

Over the traffic of cities——over the rumble of wheels
in the streets3

Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the
houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,

No bargainers’ bargains by day—no brokers or
speculators—would they continue?
