THE PLEASANT 151AE OF Avizs

On England is a pleasant place for them that's rich
and high,

But England is a cruel place for such poor folks asI;

And such a port for mariners I ne'er shall see again

As the pleasant Isle of Aves, beside the Spanish
mam.

There were forty craft in Av'es that were both swift
and stout,

All {urnished well with small arms and cannons
round about 3

And a thousand men in Aves made laws so fair and
free

To choose their valiant captains and obey them
loyally.

Thence we sailed against the Spaniard with his
hoards of plate and gold,

Which he wrung with cruel tortures from Indian
folk of old3

Likewise the merchant captains‚ with hearts as hard
as stone,

Who flog men and keel·haul them, and starve them
to the bone.

O the palms grew high in Aves, and fruits that
shone like gold,

And the colibris and parrots they were gdrgeous to
behold 3
