WELCOME, wild North-easter.
Sharne it is to see
Odes to every zephyr;
Ne’er a verse to thee.
Welcome, black North-easter!
O'er the German foam5
O'er the Danish moorlands,
From thy frozen home.
Tired we are of summer,
Tired of gaudy glare,
Showers soit and steaming,
Hot and breathless air.
Tired of listless dreaming,
Through the lazy day:
Jovial wind of winter
Turns us out to play!
Sweep the goldcn rced-beds;
Crisp the lazy dyke;
Hunger into madness
Every plunging pike.
Fill the lake with wild-fow13
Fill the marsh with snipe;
While on dreary moorlands
Loncly curlew pipe.
Through the black fir-forest
Thunder harsh and dry,
Shattering down the snow-flakes
Off the eurdled sky.
