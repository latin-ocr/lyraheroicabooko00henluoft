KINGSLEY

Hark! The brave N orth-easter!
Breast—high lies the seem,
On by holt and headland,
Over heath and bent.
Chime‚ ye dappled darlings,
Through the sleet and snow.
Who can over-ride you?
Let the horses go!
Chime, ye dappled dmlings,
Down the roaring blast3
You shall see a fox die
Ere an bour be past.

Go! and rest to—morrow‚
Hunting in your dreams,
While our skates are ringing
O’er the frozen streams.
Let the luscious South-wind
Breathe in lovers' sighs,

While the lazy gallants
Bask in laidies’ eyes.

What does he but §often
Heart alike and pen?

’Tis the hard grey weather
Breeds hard English men.
What’s the soft South-wester?

’Tis the ladies⁷ breeze,
Bringing home their true-loves
Out of all the seas:
But the black North-easter,

Through the snowstorm hurled,

Drives our English hearts of oak
Seaward round the world.
