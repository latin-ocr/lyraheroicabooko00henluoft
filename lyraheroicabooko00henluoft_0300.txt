264 YULE

Come, as came our fathers,
Heralded by thee,
Conquering from the eastward,
Lords by land and sea.
Come; and strong within us
Stir the Vikings' blood;
Bracing brain and sinew;

Blow‚ thou wind of God!
Kingxley.

THE BIRKENHEAD

Amo the loud ebriety of War,

With shouts of ‘la Republique ¹ and ‘la Gloire,’
The Vengeur’s crew, 'twas said, with flying flag
And broadside blazing level with the wave
Went down erect, defiant, to their grave
Beneath the sea.—’Twas but a F renchman's brag,
Yet Europe rang with it for many a year.

Now we recount no fab1e; Europe, hear!

And when they tell thee ‘Eng1and is a fen
Corrupt, a kingdom tottering to decay‚

Her nerveless burghers lying an easy prey

For the first comer‚’ ten how the other day

A crew of half a thousand Englishmen

Went down into the deep in Simon's Bay!

Not with the cheer of battle in the throat,
Or cannon-glare and din to stir their blood,
But, roused from dreams of home to find their boat
