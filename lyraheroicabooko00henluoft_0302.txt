ARNOLD

Where the moon-silvered inlets
Send far their light voice

Up the still vale of Thisbe,

O speed, and rejoice!

On the sward at the cliii-top
Lie strewn the white flocks.
On the cliff-side the pigeons
Roost deep in the rocks.

In the moonlight the shepheffls,
Soft luned by the rills,

Lie wrapt in their blankets
Asleep on the hills.

——XVhat forms are these coming
So white through the gloom?
What garments out-glistening
The gold-flowered broom?

What sweet-breathing presence
Out-perfumes the thyme?
What voices enrapture

The night's balmy prime ?—

’Tis Apollo comes leading
His choir, the Nine.
—The leader is fairest,
But all are divine.

They are lost in the hollowsl
They stream up again!
What seeks on this mountain
The glorified tulin?—
