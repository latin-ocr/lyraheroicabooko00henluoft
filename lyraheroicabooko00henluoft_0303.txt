They bathe on this mountain,
In the spring by the road;
'l'hen on to Olympus,

'l'heir endless abode.

——Whose praise do they mention?
Of what is it told ?—

What will be for ever3

What was from of old.

First hymn they the Father
Of all thing33 and then,
The rest of immortals‚

The aetion of men.

The day in his hotness‚
The strife with the palm5
The night in her silence,
The stars in their calm.

THE DEATH OF SOHRAB

THE DUEL

HE spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,
And he too drew his sword3 at once they rushed
Together‚ as two eagles on one prey
Come rushing down together from the clouds,
One from the east, one from the west3 their shields
Dashed with a clang together, and a din
Rose, such as that the sinewy woodeutters
Make often in the forest's heart at morn,
