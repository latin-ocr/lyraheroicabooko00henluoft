268 ARNOLD

Of hewing axes, crashing trees-such blows
Rustum and Sohrab on each other hassed.

And you would say that sun and stars took part
In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud

Grew suddenly in Hem-en, and darkened the sun
Over the fighters‘ heads3 and a wind rose

Under their feet, and monning swept the plain,
And in a sandy whirlwind wrapped the pair.

In gloom they twain were wrapped, and they alone ; ἡ

For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
stood in broad daylight‚ and the sky was pure,
And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.

But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes

And labouring breath ς first Rustum struck the shield ⁹

Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear
Rent the tough plates, but failed to reach the skin,
And Rustum plucked it back with angry groan.
Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum’s belm,
Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the erest
He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,
Never till now defiled, sank to the dust3

And Rustum bowed his head ; but then the gloom
Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,

And lightnings rent the cloud3 and Ruksh, the horse,
W ho stood at hand, uttered a dreadful cry3—

No horse’s cry was that, most like the roar

Of some pained desert-lion, who all day

Hath trailed the hunter's javelin in his side,

And comes at night to die upon the sand.

The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for sear,
And Oxus curdled as it crossed his stream.
