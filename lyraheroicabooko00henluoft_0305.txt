ARN OLD 269

But Sohrab heard, and quailed not, but rushed on,
And struck again ; and again Rustum bowed

His head3 but this time all the blade, like glass,
Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,

And in the hand the hilt remained alone.

Then Rustum raised his head3 his dreadful eyes
Glared‚ and he shook on high his menacing spear,
And shouted: Rustzth—Sohrab heard that shout‚
And shrank amazed3 back he recoiled one step,

And scanned with blinking eyes the advancing form 3
And then he stood bewildered; and he dropped

His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.
He reeled, and staggering back, sank to the ground ς
And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,
And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all

The cloud 3 and the two armies saw the pair—

Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,

And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.

SOHRAB

Then with a bitter smile, R'ustum began :—
‘Sohrab‚ thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill
A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse, Ἰ
And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab’s tent.
Or else that the great Rustum would come down
Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move
His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.
And then that all the Tartar host would praise
Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,
To glad thy father in his weak old age.
