270 ARN OLD

Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!

Dearer to the red jackels shalt thou be

Than to thy friends, and to thy father old.'
And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:—

‘Unknown thou art3 yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.

'l'hou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!

No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.

For were Ι matched with ten such men as thee,

And I were that which till to-day I was,

'l'hey should be lying here, I standing there.

But that beloved name unnerved my arm—

That name, and something, I confess, in thee,

Which troubles all my beart, and made my shield

Fa11; and thy spear transfix an unarmed foe.

And now thou boastest‚ and insultest my fate.

But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:

The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!

My father, whom Ι seek through all the world,

He shall avenge my death, and punish thee! '
As when some hunter in the spring hath found

A breeding engle sitting on her nest,

Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,

And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,

And followed her to find her where she fell

Far oin—anon her mate comes winging back

From hunting‚ and a great way off decries

His huddling young left-sole; at that he checks

His pinion‚ and with short uneasy sweeps

Circles above his eyry, with loud screams

Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she

Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,
