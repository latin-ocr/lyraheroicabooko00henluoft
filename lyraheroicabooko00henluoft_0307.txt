In some far stony gorge out of his ken,
A heap of fluttering feathers—never more
Shall the lake glass her, flying over it,
Never the black and dripping precipices
Echo her stormy 56163111 35 5116 53115 by—
As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,
So Rustum knew not his own 1055, 1)111 510οᾶ
Over his dying son, and knew him not.

But, with a cold, incredulous voice he said:
‘What prate 15 11115 of fathers and revenge?
The mighty Rustum never had 3 5011.’

And with a failing voice Sohrab replied:
‘Ah yes, he had! and that lost son 3111 1,
Surely the news will one day 163611 1115 631,
Reach Rustum‚ where he sits, and 1311165 long,
Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here ;
And pierce him like 3 5131), and make him leap
To arms, and cry 101 vengeanee upon thee.
Fierce man, bethink thee, for 311 only son!
What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?
Ο 60111(1 Ι live, till I that grief had seen 1
Yet him I pity not so much, but her,
My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells
With that old king, her father, who grows grey
With age, and 111165 over the valiant Koords. ¹
Her most Ι pity, who no more will see
Sohrab returning from the 'l‘artar camp,
With spoils and honour, when the war is done.
But 3 dark 1111110111 will be bruited up,
From tribe to tribe, until it 163611 1161 631;
And then will that defeneeless woman 163111
