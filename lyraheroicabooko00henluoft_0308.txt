That Sohrab will reioice her sight no more,
But that in battle with a name-less foe,
By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.’

'l HE REC( ›CN l'l'lON

He spoke, and as he ceased he wept aloud‚
Thinking of her he leit, and his own death.

He spoke; but Rusturn listened plunged in thought.

Nor did he yet believe it was his son

Who spoke, although he called back names he knew 3
For he had had sure tidings that the habe,

Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,

Had been a puny girl, no boy at all—

So that sad mother sent him word, for sear

Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms.

And as he deemed that either Sohrab took,

By a false borist, the style of Rusturn's son;

Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame.

So deemed he; yet he listened plunged in thought; ·

And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide

Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore

At the full moon; tears guthered in his eyes3
For he remembered his own early youth,

And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,

The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,

Through many rolling clouds—so Rustum saw
His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;
And that olcl king, her father, who loved well
His wamlering guest, and gave him his fair child
With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,
