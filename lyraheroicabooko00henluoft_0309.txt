ARNOLD 273

They three, in that long-distant summer-time—
The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt
And hound, and morn on those delightful hills
In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth‚
Of age and looks to be his own dear son,
Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,
Like some rich hyacinth which by the seythe
Of an unskilful gardener has been eut,
Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,
And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,
On the mown, dying grass—so Sohrab lay,
Lovely in death, upon the common sand.
And Rustum gazed on him in grief, and said:
‘O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son
Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved:
Yet here thou errest‚ Sohrab, or else rnen
Have told thee false—thou art not Rustum’s son.
For Rustum had no son ; one child he had—
But one—a girl ; who with her mother now
Plies some light female task‚ nor dreams of us—
Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.'
’ But Sohrab answered him in w rath: for now
The anguish of the deep- fixed spear grew fieree,
And he desired to draw forth the steel,
And iet the blood flow free, and so to die—
But first he would convince his stubborn foe3
And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:
‘Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?
Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,
And fahehood, while I lived, was far from mine.
1 tell thee, pricked upon this arm I bear
