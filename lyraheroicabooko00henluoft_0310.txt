That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,

That she might prick it on the bahe she bore.’
He spoke; and all the blood iest Rustum's cheeks‚

And his knees tottered, and he smote his hand

Against his breast‚ his heavy mailed hand,

That the hard iron corselet clanked aloud ;

And to his heart he pressed the other hand,

And in a hollow voice he spake and said:
‘Sohrab, that were a proof that could not lie!

15 thou show this, then art thou Rustum’s son.’
Then with weak hasty fingers Sohrab loosed

His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,

And showed a sign in faint vermilion points

Pricked‚· as a cunning workman, in Pekin,

Pricks with vermilion sorne clear porcelain vase,

An emperor‘s gift—at early rnorn he paints,

And all day long, and, when night comeS, the lamp

Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands—

So delicately pricked the sign appeared

On Sohrab’s arm, the sign of Rustum’s seal.

It was that griffin, which of old reared Zal,

Rustum·s great father, whom they lest to die,

A helpless babe, among the mountain rocks;

Him that kind creature found, and reared, and

loved—

Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.

And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,

And himself scanned it long with mournful eyes,

And then he touched it with his hand and said :—
‘1 Iow sayest thou? Is that sign the proper sign

Of Rustum’s son, or of some other man’s? ’
