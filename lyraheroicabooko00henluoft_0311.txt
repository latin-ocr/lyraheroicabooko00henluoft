ARN OLD 275

RUKSH THE HORSE

He spoke 3 but Rustum gazed, and gazed‚ and stood
Speechless3 and then he uttered one sharp cry:
0 bey—thyfathers—and his voice choked there.
And then a dark cloud passed before his eyes,
And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.
But Sohrab crawled to where he lay, and cast
His arms about his neck, and kissed his lips,
And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,
Trying to call him back to life,- and life
Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,
And they stood wide with horror 3 and he seized
In both his hands the dust which lay around,
And threw it on his head, and smirched his hair,—
His hair, and face, and heard, and glittering arms;
And strong eonvulsive groanings shook his breast‚
And his sobs choked him ; and he clutched his sword,
To draw it, and for ever let life out.
But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,
And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:
‘Father, sorbeat! for Ι but meet to-day
The doom which at my birth was written down
In Heaven, and thou art Heaven’s unconscious hand.
Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,
When first Ι saw thee,- and thy heart spoke too,
Ι know it! but fate trod these promptings down
Under its iron hee13 fate, fate engaged
The strife, and hurled me on my father's spear.
But let us speak no more of this! I find
My father3 let me feel that I have found!
