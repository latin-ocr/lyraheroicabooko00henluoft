27ss ARNOLD

Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take
My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,
And wash them with thy team, and say: ΑΙ] son!
Quick! quick! for numbcred are my sands οἱ life,
And swift; for like the lightning to this field
I came, and like the wind 1 go away—
Sudden, aud swift, and like a passing wind.
But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.’
So said he, and his voice released the heart
Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth3 he cast
His arms round his son’s neck, and wept aloud,
And kissed him. And awe fell on both the hosts,
When they saw Rustum’s grief 3 and Ruksh the
horse,
With his head bowing to the ground and mane
Sweeping the dust‚ came near, and in mute woe
F irst to the one, then to the other moved
His head, as if inquiring what their grief
Might mean3 and from his dark, compassionate eyes,
The big warm tears rolled down, and caked the sand.
But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said :—
‘Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet
Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,
Or ere they brought thy master to this field! '
But Sohrab looked upon the horse and said:
‘Is this, then, Ruksh? How often in past days,
My mother told me οἱ thee, thou brave steed,
My terrible father’s terrible horse! and said,
'l‘hat I should one day find thy lord and thee.
Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane! ·
O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than 15
