ARNOLD 277

For thou hast gone where I shall never go,

And snuffed the breezes of my father's horne.
And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,

And seen the river of Helmund‚ and the Lake
Of Zirrah, and the aged Zal himself

Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food‚
Corn in a golden platter soaked with wine,

And said: O Rukslz! bear Rustum welbf—but I
Have never known my grandsire's furrowed face,
Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,

Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream 3
But lodged among my father's foes, and seen
Afrasiab’s cities only, Samarcand,

Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,

And the black Toorkman tents3 and only drunk
The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,

Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,
The northern Sir, and this great Oxus stream,
The yellow Oxus, byn-hose brink I die.'

RUSTUM

Then with a heavy groan, Rustum bewailed:
i ‘ O that its waves were flowing over me ἔ
Ο that Ι saw its grains of yellow silt
Roll tumbling in the current o’er my headl⁹
But with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:—
‘Desire not that, my father! thou must live.
For some are bom to do great deeds, and live,
As some are born to be obscured, and die.
Do thou the deeds Ι die too young to do,
