ARNOLD 279

And 1 will spate thy host3 yea, let them go!
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!
What should Ι do with slaying any more?
For would that all whom I have ever slain
Might be once more alive—my bitterest foes,
And they who were called champions in their time,
And through whose death I won that fame I
have—

And 1 were nothing but a common man,
A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,
So thou mightest live too, my son, my son !
Or rather would that Ι, even Ι myself,
Might now be lying on this bloody sand,
Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,
Not thou of mine! and Ι might die, not thou,
And Ι, not thou, be borne to Seistan3
And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine3
And say: O Son, I weep tlzee not too sore,
For willingly‚ I know„ thou met’st lln'ne end!
But now in blood and battles was my youth,
And full of blood and battles is my age,
And Ι shall never end this life οἱ blood.⁷

Then at the point of death, Sohrab replied:
‘A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man! ¹
But thou shalt yet have peace 3 only not now,
Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,
When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,
Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo
Returning home over the salt blue sea,
From laying thy dear master in his grave.'
