NIGHT

And Rustum gazed in Sohrab‘s face, and said:
‘Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!
'l'ill then, if fate so wills, let me endure.'

He spoke; and Sohrab sniiled on him, and took
The spcar, and drew it from his side, and eased
His wound’s imperious anguish3 but the blood
Came welling from the open gash, and life
Flowed with the stream ;—all down his cold white

side
The crimson torrent ran, dirn now and soiled,
Like the soiled tissue oi white violets
Left, freshly gathered, on their native bank,
By children whom their nurses call with haste
Indoors from the sun’s eye ; his head dropped low,
His liinbs grew slack; motionless‚ white, he lay—
White, with eyes closed ; only when heavy gasps,
Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,
Convulsed him back to life, he opened thern,
And fixed thern feebly on his father’s face5
Tin now all strength was ebbed, and from his limbs
Unwillingly the spirit fled away,
Regretting the warm mansion which it lest,
And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.

So, on the bloody sand‚ Sohrab lay dead ς
And the great Rustum drew his horseman’s cloak
Down o’er his face, and sate by his dead son.

As those black granite pillars once high-reared
By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear
His house, now ’mid their broken ssights οἱ steps
