ARNOLD 281

Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side,
So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.
And night came down over the solemn waste,

And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,

And darkened all,- and a cold sog, with night,
Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,

As of a great assembly loosed, and fires

Began to twinkle through the sog, for now

Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal 3
The Persians took it on the open sands
Southward, the Tartars by the river marge 3

And Rustum and his son were left alone.

But the maJestic river floated on,

Out of the mist and hum of that low land,

Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,
-Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste,
Under the solitary moon 3-—he fiowed

Right for the polar star, past Orgunje,

Brimming, and bright, and large ; then sands begin
To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,
And split his currents3 that for many a league
The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along
Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles—-
Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had

In his high mountain cradle in Parnere

A foiled circuitous wanderer—till at last

The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide
His luminous home of waters opens, bright

And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars
Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.
