282 ARNOLD

CIX
FLEE FRO’ THE PRESS

O noim in days when wits were fresh and clear
And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames3 ·
Before this strange disease of modern life,

With its sick hurry, its divided aims,
Its heads o’ertaxed‚ its palsied hearts, was rife—
Fly hence, our contact sear!
Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!
Averse, as Dido did with gesture stem
From her false friend’s approach in Hades tum,
Wave us away and keep thy solitude!

Still nursing the unconquerable hope,
Stin clutching the inviolable shade,
With a free, onward impulse brushing through,
By night, the silvered branchos of the glade—
Far on the forest-skins, where none pursue,
On some mild pastoral slope
Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales
F rcshen thy ssowers as in former years
With dew, or listen with enchanted ears,
From the dark dingles, to the nightingalesl

   

But ssy our paths, our severish contact fly!
For strong the infection os our mental strife,
Which, though it gives no biiss, yet spoils for rest ;
And wc should win thee from thy own fair life,
