ARN OLD 283

Like us distracted, and like us unblest.
Soon, soon thy cheer would die,

Thy hopes grow timorous‚ and unfixed thy powers,
And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made,-
And then thy glad perennial youth would fade,

Fade‚ and grow old at last, and die like ours.

Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!
As some grave T yrian trader, from the sea,
Descried at sunrise an emerging prow
Lifting the eool-haired creepers steasthily,
The fringes of a southward—facing brow
Among the AEgaean isles3
And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,
Freighted with amber grapes, and (ss'hian wine,
Green, bursting figs, and tunnies steeped in
brine—
And knew the intruders on his ancient home,

The young light-hearted masters of the waves—
And snatched his rudder, and shook out more
sail;
And day and night held 011 indignantly
O’er the blue Midland waters with the gale,
Betwixt the Syrtes and soit Sicily,
To where the Atlantic raves
Outside the western straits ; and unbent sails
There, where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of
foam,
Shy traffickers‚ the dark lberians come3
And on the beach undid his corded bales.
