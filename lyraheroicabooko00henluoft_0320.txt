284 CORY

cx
SCHOOL FENCIBLES

wss come in arms, we stand ten scote,
Embattled on the castle green ς
We grasp our firelocks tight, for war
Is threatening, and we see our Queen.
And ‘Will the churls last out till we
Have duly hardened bones and thews
For scouring leagues of swamp and sea
Of braggart mobs and corsair crews? '
We ask3 we fear not scoff or smile
At meek attire of blue and grey,
For the proud wrath 'that thrills our isle
Gives saith ancl force to this array.
So great a charm is England's right,
'l‘hat hearts enlarged together flow,
And each man rises up a knight
To work the evil—thinkers woe.
And, girt with ancient truth and grace,
We do our service and our suit,
And each can be, whate’er his tace,
A Chandos or a Montacute.
Thou, Mistress, whom we serve to-day,
Bless the real swords that we shall wield,
Repeat the call we now obey
In sunsct lands, on some fair field.
Thy flag shall make some Huron rock
As dcar to us as Windsor's keep,
And arms thy 'l'hames bath nerved shall mock
The surgings of th’ Ontarian deep.
