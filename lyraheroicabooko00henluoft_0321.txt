CORY 285

The stately music of thy Guards,
Which times our march beneath thy ken,
Shall sound‚ with spells of sacred bards,
From heart to heart, when we are men.
And when we bleed on alien earth,
We’ll call to mind how cheers of ours
Proclaimed a loud uncourtly mirth
Amongst thy glowing orange bowers.
And if for England’s sake we fall,
So be it, so thy cross be won, .
Fixed by kind hands on silvered pall,
And worn in death, for duty done.
Ah! thus we fondle Death, the soldier’s mate,
Blending his image with the hopes of youth
To hallow all3 meanwhile the hidden fate
Chills not our fancies with the iron truth.
Death from afar we call, and Death is here,
To choose out him who wears the loftiest mien;
And Grief, the cruelllord who knows no peer,
Breaks through the shield οἱ love to pierce our
Queen.

CXI
THE TWO CAPTAINS

WHEN George the Third was reigning a hundred
years ago,

He ordered Captain Farmer to chase the foreign foe.

'You‘re not afraid of shot‚’ said he, ‘you’re not
afraid of wreck,

So cruise about the west of France in the {rigate

called Quebec.
