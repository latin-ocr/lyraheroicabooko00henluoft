236 CORY

Quebec was once a Frenchman's town, but twenty
years ago

King Georgo the Second sent a man called Genera}
Wolfe, you know,

To clamber ιη) a precipice and {ook into Quebec,

As you’d look down a hatchway when standing on
the deck.

11 Wolfe could beat the Frenchmen then so you can
beat them now.

Before he got inside the town he died, 1 must allow.

But since the town was won for us it is a lucky name,

And you'll remember Wolfe's good work, and you
shall do the same.’

Then Farmer said, ‘I'll try, sir‚' and Farmer bowed
so low

That George could sec his pigtail tied in a velvet bow.

George gave him his commission, and that it might
be safer,

Signed ‘King of Britain, King of Franee,' and sealed
it with a waser.

Then prond was Captain Farmer in a frigate of his own,

And grander on bis quarter-deck than George upon
the throne. ”

He'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck ten,

And twenty on the gun-deck, and more than ten
score men.

And as a huntsmzrn scours the brakes with sixteen
brace of dags,
With two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the (ogs.
