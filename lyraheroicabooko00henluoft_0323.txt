CORY 287

From Cape la Hogue to Ushant‚ from Rochefort to
Belleisle,

She hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on
her keel.

The fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright with
‘melting tar,

The lad up in the foretop sees square white sails
afar;

The east wind drives three square-sailed masts from
out the Breton bay,

And ‘Clear for actionl’ Farmer shouts‚ and reefers

yell ‘Hoorayl '

The F renchman's captain had a name I·wish I could

pronounce3
A Breton gentleman was he, and wholly free from

bounce
One like thdse famous fellows who died by guillotine
For honour and the fleurs-de-lys and Antoinette the
Queen.

The Catholic for Louis, the Protestant for George,
Each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly smiths

could forge3 Ι
And both were simple seamen, but both could

understand
χ How each was bound to win or die for flag and

native land.

The French ship was la Sto-vez‘llczaezle, which mea-ns

the watchful maid3
She folded up her head-dress and began to cannonade.
