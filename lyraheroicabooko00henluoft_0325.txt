CORY 289

And where t'he waves leapt lower, and the riddled
ship went slower‚

In triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-boats to
tow her.

They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for
F armer dead 3

And as the wounded captives passed each Breton
bowed the head.

Then spoke the French Lieutenant‚ ‘’Twas fire that
won, not we.

You never struck your flag to us 3 you‘ll go to
England free!

’Twas the sixth day of October, seventeen hundred
seventy—nine,

A year when nations ventured against us to com-
bine,

Quebec was burnt and Farmer slain, by us re-
membered not 3 '

But thanks be to the French book wherein they're
not forgot.

Now yon, if you’ve to fight the F rench, my youngster,
bear in mind

Those scarnen of King Louis so chivalrous and
kind3

¹ Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to

Brest,
And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a

guest.
