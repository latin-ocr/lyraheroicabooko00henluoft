THE HEAD OF BRAN

Wums the head os Bran
Was firm on British shoulders‚

God made a man!
Cried all beholders.

Steel could not resist
The weight his arm would rattle;
He with naked fist
Has brained a knight in battle.

He marched on the foe,

And never counted numbers ;
F oreign widows know

The hosts he sent to slumbers.

As a street you scan
That’s towered by the steeple,
So thc head of Bran

Rose o’er his people.

‘Death's my neighbour,’
Quoth Bran the blest5
‘Christian labour
Brings Christian rest.

From the trunk sever
'l'he head of Bran,

That which never
Has bent to man!
