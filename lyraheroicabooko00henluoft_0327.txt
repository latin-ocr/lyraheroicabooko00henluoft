MEREDITH

That which never

To men has bowed
Shall live ever

To shame the shroud:
Shall live ever

To face the f0e3
Sever it, sever,

And with one blow.

Be it written,

That all I wrought
Was for Britain,

In deed and thought:
Be it written,

That‚ while I die,
“Glory to Britain!”

Is my last cry.

“ Glory to Britain! ''

Death echoes me round.

Glory to Britain!

The world shall resound.

Glory to Britain!

In ruin and fall,
Glory to Britain!

Is heard over all.‘

Bum, Sun, down the sea!
Bran lies low with thee.

Burst‚ Morn, from the main!
Bran so shall rise again. ’
