MORRIS 293

Brim the horn! a health is drunk,
Now, that shall keep going:

Life is but the pebble sunk‚
Deeds, the circle growing!

Fill, and pledge the Head of Bran!
While his lead they follow,

Long shall heads in Britain plan

Speech Death cannot swallow.

THE SLAYING OF THE NIBLUNGS

HOGNI

ΥΕ shall know that in Atli’s feast-hall on the side
that joined the house

Were many carven doorways whose work was glori-
ous

With marble stones and gold-work, and their doors
of beaten brass:

Lo now, in the merry morning how the story eometh
to pass!

—While the echoes of the trumpet yet fill the
people's ears,

And Hogni casts by the war-horn, and his Dwarf-
wrought sword uprears,

All those doors aforesaid open, and in pour the
streams of steel‚

The best of the Eastland champions‚ the bold men
of Atli's weal:
