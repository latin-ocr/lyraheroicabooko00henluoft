MORRIS 295

Unspeakable, unchanging, with white unknitted
brow

With half-closed lips untrembling‚ with deedless
hands and cold

Laid still on knees that stir not, and the linen’s
moveless sold.

Turned Hogni unto the spem-wall, and smote from
where he stood,

And hewed with his sword two-handed as the axe-
man in a wood:

Before his sword was a champion, and the edges clave
to the chin,

And the first man fell in the feast-hall of those that
should fall therein.

Then man with man was dealing, and the Niblung
host of war

Was swept by the· leaping iron, as the rock anigh
the shore Ι .

By the ice-cold waves of winter: yet a moment
Gunnar stayed

As high in his hand unblooded he shook his awful
blade3

And he cried: ‘O Eastland champions, do ye behold

it here,

The sword of the ancient Giuki? Fall on and have
no fear,

But slay and be slain and be famous, if your master's
will it be!

Yet are we the blameless Niblungs, and bidden
guests are we:
