So sorbeat, if ye wander hond-winked, nor for nothing
slay and be slain3 '

For I know not what zo tel! you of the dead that -1
live again.'

So he saith in the midst οἱ the foemen with his war·
flame reared on high,

But all about and around him goes up a bitter cry

From the iron men οἱ Atii, and the bickering of the
steel

Sends a roar up to the roos-ridge‚ and the Niblung
war-ranks reel

Behind the steadiast Gunnar: but lo! have ye seen
the corn,

While yet men grind the sickle, by the wind-streak ,
overborne

When the sudden rain sweeps downward, and sum-
mer groweth black,

And the smitten wood-side roareth ’neath the driv-
ing thunder-wrack?

So before the wisc-beart Hogni shrank the champions
of the East,

As his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of
Atli’s feast.

There he smote, and beheld not the smitten, and by
nought were his edges stopped3

He smotc, and the dead were thrust from him; a
hand with its shield he lopped3

There met him Alti’s marshal, and his arm at the
shoulder he shred ;

Three swords were upreared against him of the best
οἱ the kin οἱ the dead;
