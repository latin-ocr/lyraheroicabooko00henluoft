And rejoiced and leapt at the Eastmen‚ and «3ῐὶοᾶ
as it met the rings
Of a Giant οἱ King Atli and a murder-wolff of king„
But it quenched its thirst in his entrails, and knew·
the heart in his breast,
And hearkened the praise οἱ Gunuar, and lingered'
not to rest, ’
But fell upon Atli‘s brother, and stayed not in him
braim
Then he fell, and the King leapt over, and clave av·
neck atwain, t
And leapt o’er the sweep of a pole-axe, and thrust a·
lord in the throat,
And King Atli’s banner-bearer through shield and
hauberk smote;
Then he laughed on the huddled EasMolk, and
against their war-shields drave
While the white swords tossed about him, and that
, archer’s skull he clave ,
Whom Atli had bought in the Southlands for many
a pound of gold; Ῐ
And the dark-skinned fen upon Gunnarsand overss
his war-shield rolled, ⁷
And cumbered his sword for a season, and the φεῦγ’
blades fell on, ’,
And sheared the cloudy helm-crest and rents in his
· hauberk won,
And the red blood ran from Gunnar 3 till that Giuki’sr
sword outburst, Δ
As the fite—tongue from the smoulder that the Ιώ,
heap bath nursed,
