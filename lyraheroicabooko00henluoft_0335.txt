MORRIS 299

And unshielded smote King Gunnar, and sent the
Niblung song

Through the quaking stems oi battle in the hall of
Atli's wrong:

Then he rent the knitted war-hedge till by Hogni's
side he stood,

And kissed him amidst of the spem-hail, and their
cheeks were wet with blood.

Then on came the Niblung bucklers, and they drave
the East-folk home,

As the bows of the oar-driven long-ship beat off the
waves in foam:

They leave their dead behind them, and they come
to the doors and the wall,

And a few last spears from the fieeing amidst their
shield-hedge fall:

But the doors clash to in their faces, as the fleeing
rout they drive,

And sain would follow'after5 and none is left alive

In the feast-hall of King Atli. save those fishes of
the net,

And the white and silent woman above the slaughter
set.

Then biddeth the beart-wise Hogni‚ and men to
the windows climb,

And uplift the war-grey corpseS‚ dead drift of the
stormy time,

And cast them adown to their people: thence they
come aback and say ἱ

That scarce shall ye see the houses, and no whit the
wheel-worn way
