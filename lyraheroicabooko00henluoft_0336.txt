300 MORRIS

For the spears and shields of the Eastlands that
merchant city throng3

And back to the Niblung burg-gate the way see
weary-long.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Yet passeth hour on hour, and the doors they wa ’
and ward
But a long while hear no mail· clash, nor the ring«
ing of the sw;ord .
Then droop the Niblung children, and their woun
are waxen chill,
And they think of the burg by the river, and the
builded holy hill,
And their eyes are set on Gudrun as of men who·
would beseech3
But unlearned are they in craving, and know not
dastard’s speech.
Then doth Giuki’s first-begotten a deed most fair
to be told,
For his fair harp Gunnar taketh, and the warp οἷ’
silver and gold3
With the hand of a cunning harper he dealeth with
the strings,
And his voice in their midst goeth upward, as οἱ·
ancient days he sings,
01 the days before the N iblungs‚ and the days that
shall be yet ς
Till the hour of toil and smiting the warrior hem>
forgct,
Nor hear the gathering foemen, nor the sound off
swords aloof:
