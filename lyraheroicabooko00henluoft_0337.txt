MORRIS 301

Then clear the song of Gunnar goes up to the dusky

roos
And the‚coming spear-host tarries, and the hearers

w
Throssfggh‘ghe oceloisters of King Atli with lingering
footsteps go.

But Hogni looketh on Gudrun‚ and no change in

her face he sees,

And no stir in her folded linen and the deedless
hands on her knees:

Then from Gunnar’s Slde he hasteneth3 and Io! the
open door,

And a foeman treadeth the pavement‚ and his lips
are on Atli’s floor,

For Hogni is death in the doorway: then the
Niblungs turn on the foe,

And the hosts are mingled together, and blow eries
out on blow.

’ GUDRUN

Still the song goeth up from Gunmr, though his
harp to earth be laid;

But he fighteth exceeding wisely, and is many a
warrior's aid,

And he shieldeth and delivereth, and his eyes search
through the hall,

And woe is he for his fellows,as his battle-brethren fall3

For the turmoil hideth little from that glorious folk-
king’s eyes,

And o’er all he beholdeth Gudrun, and his soul is
waxen wisc,
