302 MORRIS

And he saith: ‘We shall look on Sigurd, and Sig-
mund of old days,

And see the boughs of the Branstock o'er the ancient
Volsung’s praise.’

Woe's me for the wrath of Hogni! From the door
he giveth aback .

That the Eastland slayers may enter to the murder ’
and the wrack:

Then he rageth and driveth the battle to the golden
kingly seat,

And the last of the foes he slayeth by Gudrun’s
very feet, ’

That the red blood splasheth her raiment3 and his
own blood therewithal

He casteth alost before her, and the drops on her
white hands fall:

But nought she seeth or heedeth‚ and again he turns
to fight,

Nor heedeth stroke nor wounding so he a foe may
smlte:

Then the battle opens before him, and the Niblungs
draw to his side;

As death in the world first fashioned, through the
feast-hall doth he stride.

And so once more-do the Niblungs sweep that
murder-flood of men

From the hall of toils and treason, and the doors
swing to again.

Then again is there peace for a little within the-
fateful fold;
