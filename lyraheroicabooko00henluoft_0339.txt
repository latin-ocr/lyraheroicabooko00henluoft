MORRIS 303

But the Niblungs look about them, and but few
folk they behold

Upright on their ieet {or the battle: now they elimb
alost no more,

Nor cast the dead from the windows,· but they
raise a rampart of war,

And its 5101105 are the fallen East-folk, and no lowly
wall is that.

Therein was Gunnar the mighty: on the shields of
men he sat,

'And the sons of his people hearkened, for his hand
through the harp-strings ran,

And he sang in the hall 01 1115 foeman of the Gods
and the making of man,

And how season was sundered from season in the
days of the fashioning,

And became the Summer and Autumn, and became
the Winter and Spring‚·

He sang of men’ 5 hunge r and labour, and their love
and their breeding os broil,

And their hope that' 15 105101οᾰ of famine, and their
rest that is fashioned of toil:

Fame then and the sword he sang of, and the hour
of the hardy and wise,

When the last of the living shall perish, and the
first of the dead shall arise,

And the torch shall be 111 111 1110 daylight‚ and God
unto man shall pray,

And the heart shall cry out for the hand in the
fight of the uttermost day.
