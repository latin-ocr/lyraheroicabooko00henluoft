303 AUSTIN

The doomed ship strives its utmost with mid-ocean' ¹.
mastery,

And the tall masts whip the cordage, while the
welter whirls and leam,

And they rise and reel and waver, and sink amid
the deeps:

So before the little-hearted in King Atli‘s murder-hall

Did the glorious sons oi Giuki 'neath the shielded .
onrush fall:

Sore wounded, bound and helpless, but living yet,
they lie

Till the astemoon and the even in the first oi night ’

shall die.

IS LIFE WORTH LIVING

Is life worth living? Yes, so long
As Spring revives the year,

And hails us with the cuckoo’s song,
To show that she is here;

So long as May oi April takes,
In smiles and tears, iarewell,

And windflowers dapple all the brakes,
And primroses the dell;

While children in the woodlands yet
Adorn their little laps

With ladysmock and violet,
And daisy-chain their caps;

While over orchard dafiodils
Cloud-shadows float and fleet,
