LYALL 311

And gracious Charity remains
To leaven lowly lives ,-

While there is one untrodden tract
For Intellect or will,

And men are free to think and aet
Life is worth living still.

Not care to live while English homes
Nestle in English trees,

And England’s 'l'rident-Sceptre roams
Her territorial seas!

Not li've while English songs are sung
Wherever blows the wind,

And England’s laws and England’s tongue
Enfranehise half mankind!

So long as in Pacific main,
Or on Atlantic strand,

Our kin transmit the parent strain,
And love the Mother-land,·

So long as flashe's English steel‚
And English trumpets shrill‚

He is dead already who doth not feel

Life is worth living still.
Austin.
