Massacre, torture, and black despair-3
Reading it all in my easy-chair.

Passionate prayer for a minute’s life5
Tortured crying for death as rest ;
Husband pleading for child or wife,
Pitiless stroke upon tender breast.
Was it all real as that I lay there
Lazily stretched on my easy-chair?

     

Could I believe in those hard old times,
Here in this safe luxurious age?

Were the horrors invented to season rhymez,
Or truly is man so fierce in his tage?

What could 1 suffer, and what could 1 dare? ’·

1 who was bred to that easy-chain

They were my fathers, the men of yore,
Little they recked of a cruel death ς
They would dip their hands in a heretic’s
They stood and burnt for a rule of saith.
What would I burn for, and whom not spate?
1, who had faith in an easy-chair.

Now do I see old tales are true,
Here in the clutch of a savage foe5
Now shall I know what my fathers knew,
Bodily anguish and bitter woe,
Naked and bound in the strong sun‘s glate,
Far from my civilised easy-chain ··

Now have Ι tasted and understood
That old-world feeling of mortal hate;
