LYALL 313

For the eyes all round us are hot with blood;
They will kill us coolly—they do but wast,-

While Ι, Ι would sell ten lives, at least,

For one fair stroke at that devilish priest.

Just in return for the kick he gave,

Bidding me call on the prophet¹s name3
Even a dog by this may save

Skin from the knife and soul from the flame 3
My soul! if he can let the prophet burn it,
But life is sweet if a word may earn it.

A bulloek's death, and at thirty years!
Just one phrase, and a man gets off it;
Look at that mongrel clerk in his tears
Whining aloud the name of the prophet 3
Only a formula easy to paster,
And, God Almighty‚ what can it matter?

‘Matter enough‚² will ‘my comrade say
Praying aloud here close at my side,
‘Whether you mourn in despair alway,
Cursed for ever by Christ denied3
Or whether you suffer a minute's pain
All the reward, of Heaven to gain.’

Not for a moment faltereth he,

Sure of the promise and pardon of sin;
Thus did the martyrs die, I see,

Little to lose and muckle to win;
Death means Heaven, he longs to receive it,
But what shall 1 do if I don’t believe it?
