LYALL 315

They tell fair tales of a far-off land,
Of love rekincssed, of forms renewed3
There may Ι only touch one hand
Here life‘s ruin will little be rued5
But the hand I have pressed and the voice Ι have
heard,
To lose them for ever, and all for a word!

Now do 1 feel that my heart must break
All for one glimpse of a woman's face3
Swiftly the slumbering memories wake
Odour and shadow ,of hour and place 5
One bright ray through the darkening past
Leaps from the lamp as it brightens last,

Showing me summer in western land
Now, as the cool breeze murmureth
In leaf and {lower—And here Ι stand
In this plain all bare save the shadow of death 3
Leaving my life in its, full noonday,
And no one to know why Ι flung it away.

Why? Am Ι bidding for glory’s roll?
I shall be murdered and clean forgot3
Is it a bargain to save my soul?
God, whom Ι trust in, bargains not 3
Yet for the honour of English race,
May I not live or endure disgrace.

Ay, but the word, if I could have said it,
1 by no terrors of hell perplext3
Hard to be silent and have no credit
From man in this world, or reward in the next ς
