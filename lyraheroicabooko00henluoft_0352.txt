None to bear witness and reckon the eost
Οἱ the name that is saved by the life that· ιε ¹⁰⁸3

Os men by the cause which they served u
Who moulder in myriad graves of old 5
Never a story and never a stone
Telis of the martyrs who die like me,
Just for the pride of the old countree. L ‚⁸

THE OBLATION

Asx nothing more of me, sweet3
All I can give you I give.
Heart of my heart, were it more,
More would be laid at your feet:
Love that should help you to live,
Song that should spur you to soar.

All things were nothing to give
Once to have sense of you more,
Touch you and taste of you, sweet,
Think you and breathe you and live,
Swept οἱ your wings as they soar,
Trodden by chance of your feet.

Ι that have love and no more
Give you but love of you, sweet:
He that hath more, let him give ς
He that hath wings, let him soar3
Mine is the beart at your feet
Here, that must love you to live.
