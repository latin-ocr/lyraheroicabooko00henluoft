ENGLAND

ENGLAND, queen of the waveS, whose green inviolate
girdle entings thee round,

Mother fair as the morning, where is now the place
of thy foemen found?

Stin the sea that salutes us free proclaims them
stricken‚ acclaims thee crowned.

Time may change, and the skies grow strange with
signs of treason‚ and fraud, and sear:

F oes in union of strange communion may rise against
thee from far and near:

Sloth and greed on thy strength may seed as cankers
waxing from year to year.

Yet, though treason and fierce unreason should
league and lie and defame and sumite,

We that know thee, how far below thee the hatred
burns of the sons of night,

We that love thee, behold above thee the witness
written of life in light.

Life that shines from thee shows forth signs that
none may read not by eyeless foes:

Hate, born blind, in his abject mind grows hopeful
now but as madness grows:

Love, born wise, with exultant eyes adores thy glory,
beholds and glows.

Truth is in thee, and none may win thee to lie, for-
saking the face of truth:
