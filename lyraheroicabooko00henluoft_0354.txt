318 SWINBURNE

Freedom lives by the grace she gives thee,
again from thy deathiess youth: '.
Faith should fail, and the world turn pale, wert
the prey οἱ the serpent's tooth.

  
   

Greed and fraud, unabashcd, unawed, may strive .'
sting thee at heel in vain3 ι ›
Craft and sear and mistrust may leer and moum ‘f'
murmur and plead and plain: - .
Thou art thou: and thy sunbright brow is hers „f
blasted the strength οἱ Spain. '

Mother, mother beloved‚ none other could claim
place of thee England’s place:
Earth bears none that beholds the sun so pure
record, so clothed with grace:
Dear our mother, nor son nor brother is thine, -
strong or as fair of face, .
How shalt thou be abased? or how shalt fea:
hold of thy heart? of thine, ,
England, maiden immortal, laden with charge οἱ ’ ”.
and with hopes divine? .
Earth shall wither, when eyes turned hither · ⁷ · ν
not light in her darkness shine.

England, none that is born thy son, and lives ‘⁸⁴
grace of thy glory, free, “
Lives and yearns not at heart and bums with
to serve as he worships thee3
None may sing thee: the sea-wind’s wing
down our songs as it hails the sea. “
