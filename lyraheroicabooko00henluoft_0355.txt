A JACOBITE IN EXILE

THE weary day rins down and dies,
The weary night wears through:

And never an hour is fair wi' flower, ’
And never a flower wi’ dew.

I would the day were night for me,
I would the night were day:

For then would Ι stand in my ain fair land,

As now in dreams Ι may.

O lordly flow the Loire and Seine,
And loud the dark Durance:

But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne
Than a' the fields of F rance3

And the waves of Till that speak sae still
Gleam goodlier where they glanee.

O weel were they th'at fell fighting
On dark Drumossie’s day:

They keep their hame ayont the {aem
And we die far away.

O sound they sleep‚ and saft, and deep,
But night and day wake we ;

And ever between the sea banks green
Sounds loud the sundering sea.

And ill we sleep‚ sae sair we weep
But sweet and fast sleep they:

319

And the mool that haps them roun' and laps them

Is e’en their country’s clay5
