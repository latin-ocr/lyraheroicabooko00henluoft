But the land we tread that are not dead
Is strange as night by day.

Strange as night in a strange man’s sight,
Though fair as dawn it be:

For what is here that a stranger's cheer
Should yet wax blithe to see?

The hius stand steep, the dells lie deep,
The fields are green and gold:

The hill-streams sing, and the hill-sides ring,
As ours at home of old.

But hills and flowers are nane of ours,
And ours are over sea:

And the kind strange land whereon we stand,
It wotsna what were we

Or ever we came, wi’ seathe and shame,
To try what end might be. ²

Scathe and shame, and a waefu’ name,
And a weary time and strange,

Have they that seeing a weird for dreeing
Can die, and cannot change.

Shame and scorn may we thole that mourn,
Though sair be they to dree:

But ill may we bide the thoughts we hide,
Mair keen than wind and sea.

Ill may we thole the night's watches,
And ill the weary day:

And the dreams that keep the gates of sleep,
A waetu' gift gie they;

For the songs they sing υς, the sight-2 they bring
The morri blaws all away.
