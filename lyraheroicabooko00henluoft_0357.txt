SWINBURNE

On Aikenshaw the sun blinks braW‚
The burn rins blithe and fain:
There’s nought wi’ me I wadna gie

To look thereon again.

On Keilder-side the wind blaws wide:
There sounds nae hunting-horn

That rings sae sweet as the winds that beat
Round banks where Tyne is born.

The Wansbeck sings with all her springs
The bents and braes give ear 3

But the wood that rings wi’ the sang she sings
Ι may not see nor hear,-

For far and far thae blithe burns are,
And strange is a' thing near.

The light there lightens‚ the day there brightens,

The loud wind there lives free:
Nae light comes nigh me or wind blaws by me
That Ι wad hear or see.

But O gin I were there again,
Afar ayont the faem,

Cauld and dead in the sweet saft bed
That haps my sires at hamel

We'll see nae mair the sea-banks fair,
And the sweet grey gleaming sky,

And the lordly strand of Northumberland‚
And the goodly towers thereby;

And none shall know but the winds that blow
The graves xuherein we lie.
