BRET HARTE 323

When my brothers fall around me,
Should my heart grow cold and numb? ’
But the drum
Answered, ‘Come!
Better there in death united, than in life a recreant,
—Comel ’

Thtis they answered‚—hoping‚ fearing,
Some in saith, and doubting some,
Till a trumpet-voice proclaiming,
Said, ‘My ehosen people, come! ’
Then the drum,
Lo! was dumb‚
For the great heart of the nation‚ throbbing‚ answered,
‘Lord‚ we come! ’

WHAT THE BULLET SANG

O Jov of‘creation
To be!
O rapture to fly
And be free!
Be the battle lost or won
Though its smoke shall hide the sun,
I shall find my love—the one
Α Born for me!

I shall know him where he stands,
All alone,

With the power in his hands
Not o'erthrown3
