324 DOBSON

1 shall know him by his face,
By his god-like front and grace ς
I shall hold him for a space

All my own!

It is he—O my love!

So bold!
It is I—All thy love

F oretold!
It is Ι. O love! what bliss!
Dost thou answer to my kiss?
O sweetheart! what is this

Lieth there so cold?

A BALLAD OF THE ARMADA

KING Philip had vaunted his claims;

He had sworn for a year he would sack us ς
With an army of heathenish names

He was coming to fagot and stack us 3

Like the thieves oi the sea he would track us,
And shatter our ships on the main ;

But we had bold Neptune to back us·—
And where are the galleons oi Spain?

His carackes were christened of dames

To the kirtles whereof he would tack us 3
With his saints and his gilded stem—frames

He had thought like an egg-shell to crack us3
