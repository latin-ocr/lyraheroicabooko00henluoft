Now Howard may get to his Flaccus,
And Drake to his Devon again,

And Hawkins bowl rubbers to Bacchus—-
For where are the galleons of Spain?

Let his Majesty hang to St. James
The axe that he whetted to hack us3
He must play at some lustier games
Or at sea he can hope to out-thwack us3
To his mines of Peru he would pack us
To tug at his bullet and chain 3
Alas! that his Greatness should lael< us l—
But where are the galleons of Spain?

ENVOY

GLORMNA l-the Don may attack us
Whenever his stomach be fain3
He must reaeh us before he can rack us, . . .

And where are the galleons of Spain? D b

THE WHITE PACHA

VAIN is the dream! However Hope may rave,
He perished with the folk he could not save,
And though none surely told us he is dead,
And though perehance another in his stead‚
Another, not less brave, when all was done,
Had fled unto the southward and the sun,
Had urged a way by force, or won by guile
To streams remotest of the secret Nile,
