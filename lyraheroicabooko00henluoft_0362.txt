326 STEVENSON

Had raised an army oi the Desert men,

And, waiting for his hour, had turned again
And fallen on that F alse Prophet, yet we know
GORDON is dead, and these things are not sol
Nay, not for England’s cause, nor to restore

Her trampled flag—for he loved Honour more—-
Nay, not for Life, Revenge, or Victory,

Would he have fled, whose hour had dawned to die. ·
He will not corne again, whate' er our need,
He will not come, who' ιε happy, being freed

  
   

From the deathly flesh and perishable things,
And lies of statesmen and rewards of kings.

Nay, somewhere by the sacred River’s shore

He sleeps like those who shall return no more,
No more return for all the prayers of men—-
Arthur and Charles—they never corne again!
They shall not wake, though fair the vision seem:

Whate‘er sick Hope may whisper, vain the dream! η

MOTHER AND SON

Ῑτ is not yours, O mother, to complain,
Not, mother, yours to weep,

Though nevermore your son again

Shall to your bosom creep,

Though nevermore again you watch your baby sleep.

Though in the greener paths of earth
Mother and child, no more
We wander3 and no more the birth
