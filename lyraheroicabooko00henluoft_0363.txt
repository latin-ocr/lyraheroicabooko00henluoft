STEVENSON 327

Of me whom once you bore,
Seems still the brave reward that once it seemed of
yore 5

T hough as all passes, day and night,

The seasons and the years,

From you, O mother, this defight,

This also disappears—

Some profit yet survives of all your pangs and tears.

The child, the seed, the grain of corn,

The acorn on the hill,

Each for some separate end is born

In season fit, and still

Each must in strength arise to work the Almighty
will.

So from the hearth the children fiee,

By that Almighty hand

Austerely led3 so one by sea

Goes forth, and one by land3

Nor aught of all rnen’s sons escapes from that com-
mand. '

So from the sally each obeys

The unseen Almighty nod;

So till the ending all their ways

Blind-folded loth have trod:

Nor knew their task at all, but were the tools of
God.

And as the fervent smith of yore
Beat out the glowing blade,
Nor wielded in the front of war
