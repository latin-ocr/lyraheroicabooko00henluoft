328 BEECHING

The weapons that he made,
But in the tower at home still plied his ri ‘¹
trade ς ¹

So like a sword the son shall roam
On nobler missions sent;
And as the smith remained at home

   

In peaceful turret pent, , ,
So sits the while at home the mother well content. ’

PRAYERS

Gon who created me

Nimble and light of limb,
In three elements free,

To run, to ride, to swim:
Not when the sense is dim,

But now {rom the heart of joy,

1 would remember Him:
Take the thanks of a boy.

Jesu, King and Lord,
Whose are my soes to fight,
Gird me with Thy sword
Swift and sharp and bright.
Thee would I serve if 1 might;
And conquer if 1 can,
From day-dawn till night,
T ake the strength of a man.
