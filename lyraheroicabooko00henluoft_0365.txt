KIPLING 329

Spirit of Love and Truth,
Breathing in grosser clay,
The light and flame of youth,
Delight of men in the fray,
Wisdom in strength's decay3
From pain, strife, wrong to be free
This best gift I pray,

Take my spirit to Thee.
Beecln'ng.

A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST

KAMAL is out with twenty men to raise the Border side,

And he has lifted the Colonel’s mare that is the
Colonel's pride:

He has lifted her out of the stable-door between
the dawn and the day,

And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden
her far away. '

Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop
of the Guides:

‘Is there never a man of all my men can say where
Kamal hides? '

Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of
the Ressaldar,

‘If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know
where his pickets are.

At dusk he harries the Abazai-—at dawn he is into
Bonair—

But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place
to fare,
