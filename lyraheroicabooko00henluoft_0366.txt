So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird mu
By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere ¹
win to the 'l'ongue of Jagai. ¹
But if he be passed the Tongue of Jagai, ri ”
swistly turn ye then, ¹
For the length and the breadth οἱ that grisly plaid
are sown with Karnal’s men!

The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a ηπ·
rough dun was he,
With the mouth of a bell and the beart of Heu aul
the head of the gallows-tree.
The Colonel’s son to the Fort has won, they bid him
stay to eat— Α
Who rides at the tail of a Border thies, he sits -'
long at his meat.
He‘s up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as Μ
can fly,
Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut οΙς
the Tongue of Jagai,
Till he was aware οἱ his father’s mare with Ram}
upon her back,
And when he could spy the white ot her eye, Μ
made the pistol crack.
He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whist·
ling ball went wide.
‘Ye shoot like a soldier,’ Kamal said. ‘Show now
if ye can ride.' λ
It’s up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blovm dust-
devils go,
The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare ‘
a barren doe.
