KIPLING 331

The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his
head above,

But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars as a
lady plays with a glove.

They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their
hoofs drum up the dawn,

The dun he went like a wounded buu, but the mare
like a new-roused fawn.

The dun he fell at a water-course—in a woful heap
fell he,—

And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and
pulled the rider free.

He has knocked the pistol out of his hand—small
room was there to strive—

‘ 'Twas only by favour of mine‚' quoth he, ‘ye rode
so long alive ;

There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was
not a clump of tree‚

But covered a man of my own men with his rifle
cocked on his knee.

If I had raised my bridle-hand, as Ι have held it low,

The little jackals that fiee so fast were feasting all
in a row3

If I had bowed my head on my breast‚ as Ι have
held it high,

The kite that whistles above us now were gorged
till she could not fly.’

Lightly answered the Colonel's son :—‘ Do good to
bird and beast,

But count who come for the broken meats before
thou makest a feast.
