KIPLIN G 333

So she shall go with a lifter’s dower, my turquoise
studded rein,

My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth‚ and silver
stirmps twain.’

The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-
end,

‘Ye have taken the one from a foe,' said he; ‘will
ye take the mate from a friend? ’

‘A gift for a gist,’ said Kamal straight3 ‘a limb for
the risk of a limb.

Thy father has sent his son to me, I’ll send my son
to him! '

With that he whistled his only son, who dropped
from a mountaiffcrest—

He trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked
like a lance in rest.

‘ Now here is thy master‚' Kamal said, ‘ who leads a
troop of the Guides,

And thou must rideat his left side as shield to
shoulder rides.

Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and
board and bed,

Thy life is his—thy fate it is to guard him with thy
head.

And thou must eat the white Queen's meat, and
all her foes are thine‚

And thou must harry thy father’s hold for the
peace of the Border·line‚

And thou must make a trooper tough and hack
thy way to power—-

Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when Ι am
hanged in Peshawur.’
