CXXVI
THE FLAG OF ENGLAND‘

W1NDS of the World, give answer! They are whim-
pering to and fro—
And what should they know of England who only
England know ?—
The poor little street—bred people that vapour and

sume and brag,
They are lifting their heads in the stillness to

yelp at the English F lag.

Must we borrow a clout from the Boer-—to plaster
anew with dirt?

An Irish liar's bandage, or an English coward's
shirt?

We may not speak of England3 her Flag's to sell

rshare.
What? is the Flag 'of England? Winds os the

World, declare l

The North Wind blew:—‘From Bergen my steel-

shod vanguards go:
Ι chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe 5
By the great North Lights above me I work the

will of God,
And the liner splits on the iee-fields or the Dogger

fills with cod.

1 barred my gates with iron, I shuttered my doors

with slame,
Because to force my ramparts your nutshell

navies came 3
