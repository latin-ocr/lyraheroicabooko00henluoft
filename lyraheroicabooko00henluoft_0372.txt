I took the sun from their presence, 1 cut ’
down with my blast‚ Ι· ,
And they died, but the Flag of England blew · f
ere the spirit passed. 2

T he lean white bear hath seen it in the long, l vs*
Arctic night, .
The musk-ox knows the standard that flouts ’χ ’
N orthern Light: ,
What is the Flag of England? Ye have but ··s
bergs to dare, 1
Ye have but my drifts to conquer. Go forth, f· -='
it is there! '

       
 

The South Wind sighedz—‘From the Virgins my
mid-sea course was ta’en

Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main,

Where the sea-egg flames on the coral and th·-

long-backed breakers eroon

Their endless ocean legends to the lazy, lock ᾗ

lagoon.

Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer ke '-

I waked the palms to laughter—1 tossed the sc ῃ
in the breeze—

Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,

But over the scud and the palm-trees an English
flag was ssown.

I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang
for a wisp on the Horn;
I have chased it north to the Lizard—ribbo Α(
and rolled and torn; · ·
