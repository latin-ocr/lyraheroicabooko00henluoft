KIPLING 337

1 have spread its sold o’er the dying, adrift in a
hopeless sea ;

I have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the
slave set free.

My basking sunfish know it, and wheeling albatrOSS,

Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the
Southern Cross. ,

What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my
reefs to dare,

Ye have but my seas to furrow. Go forth, for it
is there! '

The East Wind roared:—‘From the Kuriles, the
Bitter Seas, I come,
And me men call the Home-Wind, for Ι bring
the English home.
Look—look well to your shipping! By the brcath
of my mad typhoon

Ι swept your close-packed Praya and· beached
your best at Kowloon!

The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas

before,

I raped your richest roadstead—I plundered Sing-
a ore!

I set ῐῗιγ hand on the Hoogli5 as a hooded snake
she rose,

And I heaved your stoutest steamers to roost with
the startled crows.

Never the lotos closes, never the wild-fowl wake,
But a soul goes out on the East Wind that died
for England‘s sake—
