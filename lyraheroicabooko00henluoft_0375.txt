KIPLING :3:39

But whether in calm or wraek-wreath, whether by
dark or day

I heave them whole to the conger or rip their
plates away,

F irst of the scattered legions, under a shrieking
sky,

Dipping between the rollers, the English Flag
goes by.

The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it—the frozen
dews have kissed—

The morning stars have hailed it, a fellow-star in
the mist.

What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my
breath to dare,

Ye have but my waves to conquer. Go forth, for
it is there! ’
