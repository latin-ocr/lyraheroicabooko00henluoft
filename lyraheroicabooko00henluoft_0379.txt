when a man hath attained worthy ends and expectations:

XI

Written in the November of 1637, and printed next year in
the Obsequies to the Alemorie of Mr. Edward King. ‘ ln this
Monody,' the title runs, ‘the Author bewails a Learned Friend
unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish
Seas, 1637. And by occasion soretells the ruine of our corrupted
clergie, then in their height.' King, who died at five· or six-and-
twenty‚ was a personal friend of Mfflon’s, but the true accents
of grief are inaudible in Lycidas, which is, indeed, an example
as perfect as exists of Milton's capacity for turning whatever he
touched into pure poetry: an arrangement, that is¹ of ‘the best
words in the best order': or, to go still further than Coleridge, the
best words in the prescribed or inevitable sequence that makes the
arrangement art. For the innumerable allusions see Professor
Masson's edition of Milton (Macmillan‚ 1890), i. 187—201¹ and

iii. 254—276.

The Eighteemh Sonnet (Masson). ‘Written in 1655,’ says
Masson, and referring ‘to the persecution instituted, in the early
part of the year, by Charles Emmanuel 11., Duke of Savoy and
Prince of Piedmont‚ against his Protestant subjects of the
valleys of the Cottian Alps: ln January, an edict required
them to turn Romanists or quit the country out of hand; it was
enforced with such barbarity that Cromwell took the case of
, the sufferers in hand: and so vigorous was his action that the
Edict was withdrawn and a convention was signed (August 1655)
gy whgeh th⁶e7 Vaudois were permitted to worship as they would.
