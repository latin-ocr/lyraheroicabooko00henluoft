Dryden's second Ode sor Saint Cecilia's Day, Alexander's Feast,
or tlte power of Sound, as it is called, was written and printed in
1697. As it was designed for music (it was set by Jeremiah
Clarke), the closing lines of every strophe are repeated by way
of chorus. 1 have removed these repetitions as impertinent to
the effect of the poem in print, and as interrupting the rushing
vehemency of the narrative. The incident described is the burning
of Persepolis.

Written early in 1782, in memory of Robert Levett: ‘an old
and faithful friend: says Johnson, and withal ‘a very useful and
very blameless man! Excepting for the perfect odes of Cowper
(post, pp. 85, 86), in these excellent and affecting verses the
¹ classic ' note is audible for the last time in this book until we reach
the lphrgreneia of &Valter Savage Landor, who was a lad of seven
at the date of their composition. They were written seventeen
years after the publication 'of the [reliques (1765), and a full quarter
century aster the appearance ot' 7722 Βανά (1757) ; but in style they
proceed from the age of Pope. For the rest, the Augustan Muse
was an utter stranger to the fighting inspiration. Her gait was
pedestrian, her purpose (imaeue, her practice neat and formal : and
she prosed of England's greatest captain, the victor of Blenheim, as
tamelyas himself had been ‘a parson in a tye-wig'-himse1f‚ and

phot the amiable man os letters who acted as her amanuensis for
e nonce.

Ckevy Chase is here preferred to Otterbourne as appealing more
directly to Englishmen. The text is Percy's, and the movement,
like that of all the English ballads, is jog-trot enough. Sidney's
confession—that he never heard it, even from a blind fiddlcr, but it
stirred him like the sound of a trumpet—refers, no doubt, to an
earlier version than the present, which appears to date from the
first quarter of the seventeenth century. Compare T lte Brave Lord
thloughby and Ylte Honour osBristol (post, pp. 60‚73).
