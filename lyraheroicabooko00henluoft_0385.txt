XXXVI

It is worth recalling that at one time Walter Scott attributed
this gallant lyric, which he printed in the Minstrelsy, to a ‘greater
Graham '—the Marquis of Montrose.

It is told (Life, W. H. Curran, 1819) that Cur-ran met a deserter,
drank a bottle, and talked of his chances, with him, and put his

Τὴε Arethusa, Mr. Hannay tells me, being attached to Keppel's
fleet at the mouth of the ChanneL was sent to order the Belle
Paule, which was cruising with some smaller craft in search of
Keppel's ships, to corne under his stern. The Belle l-'oule (com-
manded by M. Chadeau de la Clocheterie) refusing, the Arethusa
(Captain Marshall) opened fire. The ships were iairly matched,
and in the action which ensued the Arethusa appears to have got
the worst of it. ln the end, after about an hour's fighting,
Keppel’s liners came up, and the Belle Paule made off. She
was afterwards driven ashore by a superior English force, and
it is an odd coincidence that in 1789 the Arethusa ran ashore off
Brest during her action (10th March) with l'Azgrrette. As for the
French captain, he lived to command l'Hercule, De Grasse’s lead-
ing ship in the great sea-right (121h April 1782) with Rodney off
Dominica, where he was killed.
