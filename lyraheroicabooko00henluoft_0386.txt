NOTES

XLIII

Museum, 1796. Burns told Thomson and Mrs. Dunlop that this
noble and most moving song was old; but nobody believed him
then, and nobody believes him now.

XLIV

The first four lines are old. The rest were written apparently in
1788, when the poet sent this song and Auld Lang Syne to Mrs.
Dunlop. It appeared in the Aluseum, 1790.

X LV

About 1777— —80: printed 1801. ‘One of my juvenile works: says
Burns. ‘I do not think it very remarkabley either for its merits
or demerits.¹ But Hazlitt thought the world of it, and now it
passes for one of Burns' s masterpieces.

Museum, 1796. Attrstauted, in one shape or another, to a certain
Captain O'gilvie. Sharpe, too, printed a broadside in which the
third stanza (used more than once by Sir Walter) is found as here.
But Scott Douglas (ΒΜ iii. 173) has* no doubt that this broad-
side was printed after 1796,' and as it stands the thing is assuredly
the work ot' Burns. The refrain and the metrical structure have
been used by Scott (Rokeby, lv. 28), Carlyle, Charles Kingsley
(Dulcino to Altzrgarct), and Mt. Swinburne (A Reiver's Neck Verse),
among others.

Of the first four numbers, the high-water mark of Wordsworth's
achievement, all four were written in 1802: the second and third
were published in 1803: the first and fourth in 1807. The Ode to
Duly was written in 1805, and published in 1807, to which year
belongs that Song jbr tlze Feast of Brouglzam Castle, from which
I have extracted the excellent verses here called Two Victories.

LIII—LXII

The first three numbers are from Marmion (1808): Ι. Introduc-
tion: V. 12: and vt. 18-20, 25-27, and 33-34. The next is
