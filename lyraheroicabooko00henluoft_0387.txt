This unsurpassed piece of 311, 111 which a music the most exquis-
ite is used to body forth a set of suggestions that seem dictated by
the very Spirit of Romance, was produced, under the influence of
‘an anodyne‚' as early as 1797. Coleridge, who calls it Kubla
Klzan: A Vision willein a Orcum, avers that, having fallen asleep
in his chair over a sentence from Purchas's Pilgrimage—‘Here
the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built and a stately
garden thereto; and thus ten miles of ground were enclosed with
a wall‚'—he remained unconscious for about three hours¹ ‘during
which time he had the most vivid confidence that he could not have
composed less than three hundred lines'2 *if that,' he adds, ‘can
be called composition, in which all the images rose up before
him as things, with 3 parallel production of the correspondent ex-
pressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effor‘t.¹ On
awakening, he proceeded to write out his ‘composition,' and had
set down as much of it as is printed here, when ‘he was unfortu-
nately called out by a person on business from Porloek,' whose
departure, an hour after, left him wellnigh oblivious of the rest.

Of the first, ‘ Napoleon and the British Sailor' (The Pilgrim of
Glencoe, 1842), Campbell writes that the 'anecdotc has been pub-
lished in several public journals, both French and English.¹ ‘My
belief‚' he continues, ‘ in its authenticity was confirmed by an Eng-
lishman, long resident in Boulogne, lately telling me that he remem-
bered the circumstance to have been generally talked of in the
