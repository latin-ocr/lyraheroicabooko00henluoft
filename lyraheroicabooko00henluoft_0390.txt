lee Poetecal W'orks of Robert Stephen Hawker (Kegan Paul,
1879). By permission of Mrs. R. S. Hawker. With the exception
of the chor al lines—
And shall Trelawney die?

There's twenty thousand Cornishmen
Will know the reason why!—

and which have been, ever since the imprisonment by James 11. of
the Seven Bishops—one of them Sir jonathan Trelawney-—a
popular proverb throughout Cornwall, the whole of this song was
cornposed by me in the year 1825. I wrote it under a stag-horned
oak in Sir Beville's Walk in Stowe Wood. It was sent by me
anonymously to a Plymouth paper, and there it attracted the notice
of Mr. Davies Gilbert, who reprinted it at 1115 private press at East-
bourne under the avowed impression that it was the original ballad.
It had the good fortune to win the eul‘og’y of Sir Walter Scott, who
also deemed it to be the ancient song. It was praised under the
same persuasion by Lord Macaulay and Mr. Diekens.'-Autlzor's

Os these four examples of 1118 picturesque and taking art of Long-
fellow, 1 need say no more than that all are printed in their integrity‚
with the exception of the first. This I leave the lighter by a moral
and an application, both of which, superfluous or not, are remote
from the general purpose of this book ε a confession in which I may
include the following number, ΜΓ. W hittier's Barbara Frietckie (In
W'ar- Time, 1863).
