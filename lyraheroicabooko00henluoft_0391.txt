Tiresias and Other Poems, 1885. By permission of Messrs.
Macmillan.1ncluded at Iord Tennyson's own suggestion. For
the noble seat of arms (25th October 1854) thus nobly com-
memorated, see Kinglake (v. i. 102—66). The thiee hundred
of the Heavy Brigade who made this famous charge were the
Scots Greys and the second squadron of Enniskillings, the re-
mainder of the “Heavy Brigade'’ subsequently dashing up to
their support. The “three ” were Scarlett's aide-de—camp, Elliot,
and the trumpeter, and Shegog the orderly, who had been close
behind him.'—Autlzor's Note.

The Return of tlte Guards, and other Poems, 1866. By permis-
sion of Messrs. Macmillan. As to the first, 11111011 d als with an
incident of the war with China, andis presumably rescired to in 1860,
‘Some Seiks and a private of the Buffs (or East Kent Regiment)
having remained behind with the grog-carts, fell into the hands
of the Chinese. On the next morning they were brought before
the authorities and commanded to peisorm the lxo tou. The Seiks
obeyed; but Mo) s,e the English soldier, declaring that he uould
not prostrate himself before any Chinam 111 alive, was immediately
knocked upon the head and his body thrown upon a dung 11111.’ --
Quoted by the author from lee Times. The Elgin os ligne 6 is
Henry Bruce, eighth Lord Elgin (1811-1863), then Ambassador to
China, and afterwards Governor-General of India. Compare The-
ology in Extremis (post, p. 309). Of the second, which Mr. Saints-
bury describes ‘as one of the most losty, insolent‚ and passionate
things eoncerning this matter that our time has produced: Sir
Francis notes that the incident—no doubt 3 part of the conquest
of Sindh—was told him by Sir Charles Napier, and that ‘Truckee'
(line 12)= ¹ a stronghold in the Desert‚ supposed to be unassailable
and impregnable.’
