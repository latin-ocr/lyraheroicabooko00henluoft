INDEX

A good sword and a trusty hand .

All is finished! and at length

Alone stood brave Horatius .

Amid the loud ebriety of war

And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said

Arm, arm, arm, arm! the scouts are au come in .

As 1 was walking all alane .

Ask nothing more of me, sweet . .

As the spring· -tides, w ith heavy plash .

At anchor m Hampton Roads we lay . .

At Flores' 1n the Azores Sir Richard Grenxille lay.

Attend, all je who list to hear our noble England’s
praise .

Attend you, and give ear awhile . . .

Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones .

A wet sheet and a flowing sea

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow! .
Bid me to live, and Ι will live .
Blow high, blow low, let tempests teat .
Build me straight, O worthy Mastet

But by the yellow Tiber

But see! look up—on Flodden bent

By this, though deep the evening fell .

Captain, or Colonel, ot Knight in Arms
Come, all ye jolly sailors bold
