Condemned to Hope‘s delusive inine .
Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud .

Dark1y‚ sternly, and au alone
Day by day the vessel grew .
Day, like our souls, is fiercely dark

Eleven men of England

England, queen of the waves, whose green inviolate
girdle enrings thee round

Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede

Fair stood the wind for France .
F arewell! farewell! the voice you hear .
Farewell, ye dungeons dark and strong

Get up! get up sor shame! The blooming mom .
God prosper long our noble king .

God who created me .

Go setch to mc a pint o’ wine . .

Good Lord Scroope to the hius is gane

Hame, hame, hame, barne fain wad 1 be

‘Han-k! 1 hear the tramp of thousands .

He has called him sorty Marchmen bold

Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling .

He spoke, and as he eeased he wept aloud .

He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts . . .
He spoke3 but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood .
High- -spiritcd friend .

How happy is he born or taught .

1 am the mashcd fireman with breast-bone broken
Is doughty ‹leeds my lady please .

Is sadly thinking .

1 love contempiating‚ apart .
