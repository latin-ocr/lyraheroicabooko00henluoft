362 ’ INDEX

O born in days when wits were fresh and clear .

O Brignall bank-s are wild and fair

O England is a pleasant place for them that’s rich and
high .

Of Nelson and the North

O sor a Muse of tire, that would ascend

Ost in the pleasant summer years .

O have ye na heard o’ the fause Sakelde

O how comely it is, and how reviving .

O' Joy of creation .

O Mary, at thy window be . . .

Once did She hold the gorgeous East 1n see.

On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred and
ninety-two

Othere, the old sea-captain .

Our English archers bent their bowes .

O Venice! Venice! when thy marble walls .

O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west .

Pibroch os Donuil Dhu .
Ruin seize thee, ruthless King

Should auld acquaintance be forgot

Simon Danz has come home again .

Stern Daughter of the Voice of God .

Still the song goeth up from Gunnar, though his harp
to earth be laid

Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright .

Tell me not, Sweet‚ Ι am unkind .

The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the sold

The boy stood on the burning deck

The breaking waves dashed high .

The captain stood on the carronade: ‘ First Lieutenant‚’
says he .
