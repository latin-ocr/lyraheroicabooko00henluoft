INDEX

The charge of the gallant three hundred, the Heavy
Brigade. .

The fifteenth day os July .

The forward youth that would appear .

The glories of our birth and state .

The herting loves the merry moonlight .

The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece .

The King sits in Dunfermline town

The last sunbeam . . .

The Moorish King rides up and down .

The newes was brought to Eddenborrow

The night ls past, and shines the sun .

The Sea! the Sea, the open Sea .

The stag at eve had drunk his fill .

The weary day rins down and dies

The winds were yessing, the waves were swelling .

Then speedilie to wark we gaed .

Then with a bitter smile, Rustum began

Then with a heavy groan, Rustum bewailed .

This, this is he; softly a while .

Through the blaek‚ rushing smoke bursts

Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flios

Tiger, tiger, burning bright .

’Tis time this heart should be unmoved

'roll for the Brave .

To mute and to material things .

To my true king Ι offered free from stain

To the Lords of Convention ’twas Claver'se who spoke .

’Twas at the royal feast sor Persia won .

Up from the meadows rich with corn .
Vain is the dream! However Hope may rave .

We come in arms, we stand ten score .
Welcome, wild north-easter .
