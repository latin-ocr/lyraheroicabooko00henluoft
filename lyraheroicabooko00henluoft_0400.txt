When 1 bave borne' nn memory what has turned .

When hove seith unconfined wings

When the British warrior queen .

When the heakd os Bran

Where the remote Bermudas ride.

Why sitt' st thou by that ruined hau . . .

Winds os the world, give answer! They are whimpet·

Would you hear os an old· time sea· fight

Ye shall know that m Atli’ s feast ..hall on the side that

joined the house .
Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more .
